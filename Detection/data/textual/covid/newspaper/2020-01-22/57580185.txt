Olympic qualifying events canceled and moved due to deadly Wuhan coronavirus outbreak 
 The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) also announced that the Olympic qualifying for women's football has been moved from from Wuhan to Nanjing.

It follows an outbreak of the virus last month in the city of Wuhan that has since killed 17 people, sickened hundreds and spread as far as the United States.

Chinese authorities and scientists say wild animals sold at the popular Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market market are the likely source of the new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family of viruses as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
