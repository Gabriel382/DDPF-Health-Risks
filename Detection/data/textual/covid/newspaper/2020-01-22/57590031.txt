Migraine sufferers soon may have to seek relief elsewhere after GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) announced it temporarily halted the production of two popular Excedrin products.
In a statement sent to Fox News, the company said it was not recalling either Excedrin Extra Strength Caplets and Geltabs or Excedrin Migraine Caplets and Geltabs, but that it had discovered “inconsistencies in how we transfer and weigh ingredients” in the products, and was temporarily suspending production and distribution.

“Based on available data, GSK believes that the product does not pose a safety risk to consumers,” a GSK spokesperson said via email. “However, as a precautionary measure, GSK Consumer Healthcare has voluntarily implemented a temporary discontinuation of production and distribution.” 
While the company did not say when it expects to resume production, the spokesperson said it is a “short term issue.”
