MANILA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Selloff in China steel futures continued on Wednesday amid mounting fears over the spread of a new coronavirus in the country and as market participants headed for the exit ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.

The Shanghai Futures Exchange's most-traded construction steel rebar contract SRBcv1 slumped as much as 1.9% to 3,506 yuan ($508.11) per tonne, the lowest since Dec. 26 last year. It ended the morning session down 1.5%.

Hot-rolled steel coil SHHCcv1 , used in cars and home appliances, dropped as much as 2.2% to 3,519 yuan a tonne, also the weakest since Dec. 26, and was down 1.9% by lunch break.

"People are becoming increasingly worried about this virus outbreak, which may disrupt many businesses," said Richard Lu, senior analyst at commodity consultant CRU Group's Beijing office.

Chinese stocks also extended losses on fears of the contagion, particularly as millions of Chinese people travel for Lunar New Year festivities starting this week. Cases of infection have ballooned to 440 across the country, with the death toll rising to nine.  virus has spread from central Chinese city of Wuhan to other cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.

The potential business disruptions could mean less demand for steel and steelmaking ingredients. Dalian and Singapore iron ore futures fell.

"Everybody is on holiday mode now," Lu said. "Trading activity is really slow and the price changes in the futures markets are just sentiment-driven."
