Wuhan, a Chinese city of nearly nine million people, is to temporarily shut public transport amid a virus outbreak.
Those living in the city have been told not to leave, and the airport and train stations will be closed to outgoing passengers.
Bus, subway, ferry, and long-distance transport networks will be suspended from 1000 local time on 23 January.
The outbreak has killed 17 people, and there are 440 confirmed cases.
The virus originated in a seafood market that "conducted illegal transactions of wild animals", authorities said.
It has spread from Wuhan to several Chinese provinces, the US, Thailand and South Korea.
Known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously been identified in humans.
