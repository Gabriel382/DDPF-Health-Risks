Matildas' Olympic qualifiers relocated due to coronavirus outbreak in China 
 The Matildas upcoming Olympic qualifiers have been moved amid fears of a coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China.

Australia is due to play China, Thailand and Chinese Taipei in the final round of qualifying for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but those matches will now be played in Nanjing rather than Wuhan, which has gone into lockdown.

Residents of Wuhan have been advised not to leave the city, which has closed its transport networks as officials confirm hundreds of cases of the virus have seen hospitals in the city overloaded.

The FFA said it welcomed the AFC's decision to move the tournament.

"FFA will continue to work with health experts, government departments, the AFC, and other stakeholders to monitor the situation and ensure that appropriate measures are put in place to ensure the health and wellbeing of all players and staff set to travel to China PR for the competition," it said in a statement.

On Tuesday, Matildas coach Ante Milicic said he and his team were trying to put the coronavirus threat out of their minds, and trusted organisers to make the right decision.

"I've got full confidence in the people that will be making these decisions," Milicic said.

"We're just really trying to focus on the football and trust that the appropriate steps have been put in place."

The tournament will be played from February 3-9.
