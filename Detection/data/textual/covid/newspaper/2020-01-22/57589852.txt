Coronavirus could dent oil prices, Goldman Sachs says 
 The spread of the coronavirus could negatively impact oil prices, according to a new research note from Goldman Sachs (GS).

The firm said the virus could knock $3 off the price of each oil barrel. Goldman compared this outbreak to the SARS infection from 2002 to 2003, and forecasts that the overall demand for oil could decline by 260,000 barrels per day.

Jet fuel prices will decrease the most, Goldman said, because of the "likely decline in regional air travel."

The coronavirus, which is a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected hundreds since theÂ outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December.
