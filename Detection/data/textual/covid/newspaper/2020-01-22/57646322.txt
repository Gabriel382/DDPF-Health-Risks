Advice from NSW Health on coronavirus 
 January 22, 2020. NSW Health executive director Dr Jeremy McAnulty speaks to reporters in Sydney, saying biosecurity measures are being ramped up in NSW should any cases of the deadly coronavirus present around the state. “At the present we believe the risk of transmission of the infection should it occur in NSW is probably… low but we need to be prepared,” Mr McAnulty says. NSW Health will assist commonwealth biosecurity staff at Sydney Airport to assess anyone arriving from Wuhan who is unwell, starting from Thursday. Mr McAnulty says the virus's incubation period - which means people won't be sick or have symptoms for some days after being exposed - means finding patients at the airport is "not foolproof by any means”.
