WHO commends China measures in Wuhan to limit virus spread 
 GENEVA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation (WHO) director-general said on Wednesday that measures being taken in the Chinese city of Wuhan to close down transport to limit spread of the new coronavirus showed commitment to minimising risks locally and abroad.

"What they are doing is a very, very strong measure and with full commitment. So based on the situation they are taking the action they deem is appropriate, is very important," WHO director-general Tedros Ahanom Ghebreyesus

"We stressed to them that by having a strong action not only they will control the outbreak in their country but they will also minimise the chances of this outbreak spreading internationally. So they recognise that," he said.

WHO officials said that they have not seen third or fourth generation transmission of the virus in China or secondary level spread in countries where it has spread. (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Sandra Maler)
