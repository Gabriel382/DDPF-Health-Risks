Trump says witnesses for impeachment trial up to Senate but suggests national-security concerns 
 President Donald Trump said Wednesday that calling witnesses in his impeachment trial is up to Senate lawmakers, though he suggested national-security issues were a concern.

“I would rather go the long way, I would rather interview Bolton, I would rather interview a lot of people,” Trump said in a news conference in Davos, Switzerland, referring to John Bolton, his former national security adviser. “The problem with John is that it’s a national security problem,” Trump said, adding that Bolton “knows some of my thoughts, he knows what I think about leaders.”

The president’s remarks came ahead of the resumption of his impeachment trial, and after the Senate approved rules allowing for the calling of witnesses after both sides in the trial have presented their cases.

While in Davos Trump also gave a pair of televised interviews, telling CNBC in one that the U.S. had the outbreak of the coronavirus under control and calling for more interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve since the U.S. dollar DXY, +0.05%   is strong.

With investors expecting Trump’s acquittal by the Senate, U.S. stocks SPX, +0.23%   have largely shrugged off the president’s impeachment by the House and trial in the Senate.
