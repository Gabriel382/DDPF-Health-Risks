MANILA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - China's steel futures fell for a second straight session on Wednesday but ended well off the day's lows as Beijing's response to a flu-like virus outbreak soothed frayed nerves.

Trading volumes remained thin, however, as the physical market turned quiet and market participants headed for the exits ahead of a week-long Lunar New Year holiday.

The Shanghai Futures Exchange's most-traded construction steel rebar contract SRBcv1 ended 0.5% lower at 3,558 yuan ($515.29) a tonne, after slumping as much as 1.9% earlier in the session to its lowest in nearly a month.

Hot-rolled steel coil SHHCcv1 closed down 0.8% at 3,569 yuan a tonne, recovering some lost ground after a 2.2% slump earlier in the session to its weakest in nearly a month.

Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed to curb the spread of an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus, which has killed nine people so far and infected 440 people across the country.  sentiment remained fragile, however.

"People are becoming increasingly worried about this virus outbreak, which may disrupt many businesses," said Richard Lu, senior analyst at commodity consultant CRU Group's Beijing office.

The virus has spread from the central Chinese city of Wuhan to Beijing, Shanghai and other cities, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Macau.

The health crisis could dent overall demand in China, the world's top steel producer and consumer.

"We believe the situation could worsen in coming months," analysts at Nomura said in a note. "We expect increased downward pressure on China's growth, particularly in the services sector."
