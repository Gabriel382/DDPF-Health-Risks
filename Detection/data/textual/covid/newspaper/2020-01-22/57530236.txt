China firms issue masks, travel warnings 
 Companies across China are handing out masks and warning staff to avoid the central city of Wuhan amid fears that the new flu-like coronavirus will rapidly spread during the Lunar New Year holidays.
Firms from Foxconn to Huawei and HSBC have issued advisories. The government has urged members of the public to be extra careful if showing symptoms of a fever or a cold.
The death toll rose to nine on Wednesday with more than 470 confirmed cases, Chinese health officials said.
At Foxconn's Lunar New Year party on Wednesday, founder Terry Gou advised Taiwan-based employees not to visit mainland China during the week-long holiday period.
"Colleagues and their families who have come back from Wuhan are all in isolation at home. The infection is spreading very fast," Gou added.
Company workers in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, have been wearing facemasks and getting their temperature checked, the Apple supplier also said.
Huawei has asked staff to reduce travel to Wuhan and avoid contact with animals, adding that it had set up an outbreak prevention and control team in the city to carry out disinfecting activities, according to an internal note seen by Reuters.
Citic and investment bank China International Capital have asked employees to avoid trips to Wuhan and Hubei, the province of which it is the capital, if they can, sources said. Employees who travel there are required to report the trip.
Citic has also asked staff to voluntarily quarantine themselves if they do travel to Hubei.
Huawei and Citic did not respond to requests for comment. A CICC representative declined to comment.
HSBC said it had advised employees that travel can continue to Wuhan, but has asked them to be extra vigilant.
