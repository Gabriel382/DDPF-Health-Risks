Happy Tuesday, readers—I hope you enjoyed the long weekend.



The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed on Tuesday afternoon the first case of a deadly strain of coronavirus in the U.S.



The so-called 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causes respiratory illnesses and has caused an outbreak of lung disease in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to other parts of China and Asia. The patient in the U.S. had returned to Washington from Wuhan recently and is now in isolation at the Providence Regional Medical Center in Washington.



“While originally thought to be spreading from animal-to-person, there are growing indications that limited person-to-person spread is happening. It’s unclear how easily this virus is spreading between people,” the agency wrote in a statement on Tuesday.



There are worries that the coronavirus outbreak could escalate into a full-blown pandemic if not contained quickly. The trouble is, millions of Chinese residents are set to travel for Lunar New Year celebrations, leading to heightened screenings at airports.



To date, there have been at least six reported deaths linked to the virus in Asia. Washington health authorities cautioned that the isolated case shouldn’t cause a panic, and likely poses a low threat of setting off an outbreak.
