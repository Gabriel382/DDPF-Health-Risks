Risk of coronavirus outbreak 'evolving' as multiple Australians tested 
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the risk of a coronavirus outbreak in Australia is “evolving” as a Queensland man waits to see if he has contracted the illness. A Brisbane man has been tested for the highly contagious virus, but “his symptoms have subsided and we are waiting for the pathology results,” Mr Hunt told Sky News. The spread of the respiratory virus could trigger a global health emergency with Australia joining crisis talks. Concerns of the deadly virus spreading has heightened as millions of people are preparing to travel to China for the Lunar New Year. The virus can take up to two weeks to show symptoms. Image: AP
