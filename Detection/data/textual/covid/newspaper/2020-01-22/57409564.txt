CDC confirms first US case of coronavirus that has killed 9 in China 
 Public health officials have confirmed the first U.S. case of a mysterious coronavirus that has sickened hundreds of people in China, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.

A Snohomish County, Washington State resident who was returning from China on Jan. 15 was diagnosed with the Wuhan coronavirus, according to the CDC.

Officials said the patient, a male in his 30s, is "very healthy." He is currently being isolated at a medical center in the state "out of caution" and "poses little risk" to the public, they said. The CDC said the man reached out to local health authorities last week once he started experiencing pneumonia-like symptoms.

"We're being proactive at all levels," Nancy Messonnier, CDC's director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. "CDC will be working closely with the state health department on the particulars of this patient's care."

On Wednesday, Chinese officials confirmed that nine people died as of Jan. 21.

Public health officials have confirmed more than 400 cases of the illness, which has evoked memories of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in China. Health officials have also confirmed cases in Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.

CDC officials said they continue to believe the risk of it spreading to the American public is "low." This weekend, the CDC and Homeland Security began screening people traveling to major airports in California and New York from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak is believed to have started. Health officials said Tuesday they will begin screenings at airports in Chicago and Atlanta. So far, they have screened more than 1,200 passengers.

"We hope over the next couple of days" the situation "will become clearer," Messonnier said.
