China halts travel from Wuhan amid outbreak of deadly coronavirus 
 Chinese officials have stopped travel out Wuhan as deaths surge from the outbreak of a mystery virus, according to a report.

Outbound flights and trains were canceled Thursday local time from the central Chinese city, where the coronavirus emerged, China Daily reported.

The lockdown will impact transportation starting 10 a.m. on Wuhan’s buses, subways and ferries, the report said.

Wuhan residents were urged not to leave the city unless travel was essential, according to the report.

Local officials essentially quarantined the city by suspending travel in an effort to curb the spread of the illness, which can be transmitted between people.

The death toll climbed to 17 on Wednesday with more than 540 confirmed cases of the flu-like illness.

“The rise in the mobility of the public has objectively increased the risk of the epidemic spreading,” Chinese National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin said.

The virus has spread to four other countries, including the US, where officials confirmed Tuesday that a Washington state man was diagnosed with virus.
