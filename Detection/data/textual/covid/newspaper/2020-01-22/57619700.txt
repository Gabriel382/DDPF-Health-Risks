ASX to drop from record high as investors cash out amid China virus outbreak 
 Australian shares are expected to drop from their record highs as investors lock in recent gains amid concerns of China's deadly virus outbreak spreading beyond its borders.

By 7:20am (AEDT), ASX futures were down 19 points, or 0.3 per cent.

This was despite a positive lead from Wall Street, which traded at their highest levels ever — but has since pulled back in the final hour of trade.

US investors initially shrugged off their contagion fears as technology giants like IBM reported a stronger-than-expected profit, which led to its share price jumping 3.1 per cent.

On the flipside, video streaming giant Netflix warned investors of tougher conditions in the months ahead and its share price plunged by 3.9 per cent.

The industrial-skewed Dow Jones index was flat at 29,201 points by 3:30pm (local time).

The benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq rose modestly, by 0.1 and 0.2 per cent respectively.

"Certainly, the market is spooked by it [the coronavirus infections]," said Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.

Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was steady at 68.4 US cents.

Spot gold fell sharply to 1,557.40 US an ounce, while Brent crude oil dropped to $US63.20 per barrel.

In economic news, the Bureau of Statistics will release its December job figures, and many economists predict Australia's unemployment rate will rise back to 5.3 per cent.

More to come.
