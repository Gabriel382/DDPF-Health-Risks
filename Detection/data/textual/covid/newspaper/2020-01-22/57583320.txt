17 dead as killer coronavirus spreads across world - LIVE updates 
 The coronavirus is spreading across the world with the first case confirmed in Europe.

All direct flights from coronavirus-hit Wuhan in China to Heathrow will be subjected to enhanced monitoring - with the World Health Organisation on the cusp of declaring it a public health crisis.

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said precautionary measures are being put in place after cases of the virus spread to other parts of the world.

chinaThere are no plans to introduce blanket temperature screening of all passengers, a spokesman for the DHSC said, as the incubation period for the illness can be as long as five days.

Chinese authorities have told people to stop travel into and out of Wuhan.

Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the Medical Research Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, said the estimated number of people infected with coronavirus in Wuhan is around 4,000, with a range between 1,000 and 9,700.

Asked whether it was possible the virus had already reached the UK, Prof Ferguson said he could not rule it out.

He said: "We can't rule out that possibility. The UK is not a major destination of visitors travelling out of Wuhan around the world though."
