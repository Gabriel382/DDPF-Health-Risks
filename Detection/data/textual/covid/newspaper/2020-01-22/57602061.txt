United Airlines stock falls as 737 MAX and coronavirus uncertainties offset earnings beat 
 Shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, -2.23% dropped 2.0% in afternoon trading Wednesday, to buck the gains in the airline sector, as uncertainty over the impact of the groundings of Boeing Co.'s BA, -1.10% 737 MAX planes and the coronavirus outbreak offset a fourth-quarter profit beat and upbeat guidance. United reported late-Tuesday adjusted earnings per share that was above the FactSet consensus while revenue was in line with expectations. In the post-earnings conference call with analysts early Wednesday, first-quarter adjusted EPS of 75 cents to $1.25, compared with the FactSet consensus as of Dec. 31 of 75 cents. President Scott Kirby said on the post-earnings call that a couple of challenges regarding the financial outlook had cropped up in the last 48 hours. "We also can't sit here and tell you that we know exactly how long the MAX will be grounded or what the economic impact of the Asian coronavirus would be," Kirby said, according to a FactSet transcript. "At this point, we're assessing the impact of the schedule, but we do not anticipate flying the MAX this summer." Boeing had said Tuesday that it didn't expect the MAX to return until mid-2020. United's stock has shed 6.3% over the past three months, while the NYSE Arca Airline Index XAL, +1.00% has gained 5.0% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.27% has advanced 11.1%.
