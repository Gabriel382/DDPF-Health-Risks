Air Canada shares slump after China coronavirus reported in U.S. patient 
 Air Canada sank by the most in 15 months as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus has appeared in the U.S.

The stock fell as much as 6.6 per cent, its biggest drop since October 2018 amid reports that a person in Washington state had the virus. The CDC later confirmed the news and said that the person was recently travelling in China. This is the latest development in China’s mysterious respiratory virus that has caused six deaths and infected a number of medical workers.

The outbreak is reminiscent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, pandemic that killed more than 800 people in Asia. Toronto had the most deaths from the illness outside Asia.

“At this time, we’re monitoring developments closely,” said Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick by email. “We take direction on handling of public health matters such as this from the PHAC (Public Health Agency of Canada) and other worldwide health experts.”

Air Canada reported back-to-back quarterly losses in 2003 as fewer people travelled after the outbreak of SARS. Back then, travellers avoided Toronto, the airline’s main hub, after the World Health Organization imposed a travel advisory because of the outbreaks in Canada’s biggest city.

The spread of this virus has the potential to slow growth, just as the SARS outbreak did 17 years ago, said Frances Donald, Toronto-based global chief economist at Manulife Investment Management.

“You have no choice to follow for example the SARS epidemic, which slowed growth in China and the Asian region,” Donald said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office Tuesday. “The market has no choice but pricing a probability that it becomes the outcome again.”
