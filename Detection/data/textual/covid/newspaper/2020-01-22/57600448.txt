Foreign Office issues new warning to Brits after coronavirus outbreak 
 Brits have been warned to stay away from the Wuhan area of China because of coronavirus crisis.

Nine people have died and hundreds have been affected with the SARS-like illness, which has spread from China to the US, Japan and South Korea.

Heathrow Airport has already set up a separate area for passengers arriving from Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - to keep them away from other travellers.

This evening a Foreign Office spokesman said: “In light of the latest medical information, including reports of some person-to-person transmission, and the Chinese authorities’ own advice, we are now advising against all but essential travel to Wuhan.

“The safety and security of British nationals is always our primary concern, and we advise British nationals travelling to China to remain vigilant and check our travel advice on  gov.uk .”

There are fears the virus, which can cause pneumonia, could spread to Britain and other countries in the coming days as hundreds of millions of Chinese residents travel domestically and abroad for the busy Lunar New Year.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said Public Health England is putting in place new precautions in relation to travellers to the UK from the region.

"There have been some announcements this morning about flights that come direct from the affected region to Heathrow with some additional measures there," he told Sky News.

"At the moment Public Health England have moved this from 'very low' to 'low' but obviously we want to stay ahead of the issue so we are keeping a very close eye on it.

"Initially this is to ensure that when flights come in directly into Heathrow there is a separate area for people to arrive in."
