MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 22nd January, 2020) A coronavirus infection was not confirmed in a Chinese citizen who arrived in St. Petersburg from Beijing a week ago and was hospitalized earlier on Wednesday with suspected acute respiratory syndrome, a spokesman for the city's health committee told Sputnik.
"The Chinese citizen's diagnosis was not confirmed. The results of the examination of a Russian [also hospitalized on Wednesday after arriving in St.
 Petersburg from China with suspected acute respiratory syndrome] will be known tomorrow," the official said.
The mysterious type of pneumonia broke out in Wuhan in late December and has since been confirmed by China and the World Health Organization to be a contagious new strain of coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV. At least nine people have died and more than 400 have been infected so far.
The virus has also been registered in the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Japan.
