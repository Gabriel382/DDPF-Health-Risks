British airports screen for Coronavirus as fears grow of virus spreading 
 British airports will start monitoring flights arriving from China for passengers who could be carrying the coronavirus.

Countries around the world are ramping up biosecurity measures after the new virus spread overseas, killing nine and infecting more than 400 others.

The UK health secretary will reportedly announce details of the precautionary airport measures later today.

They will apply to flights from Wuhan - where the virus originated in a seafood market - into London Heathrow, of which there are three per week.

Public Health England have upgraded the risk to the UK population from very low to low, according to the transport secretary.

It's been confirmed by the Chinese government that the virus can spread through human-to-human contact.

Countries in Asia and elsewhere are checking the body temperatures of arriving airline passengers and quarantining any that raise alarm as a precuation.

In Australia, biosecurity staff and state health officials are meeting flights from Wuhan and distributing pamphlets printed in English and Chinese to all passengers.

The pamphlets describe the symptoms of the coronavirus infection, and ask people to identify themselves if they are experiencing any of them.

Airport security in the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have all been tightened as a precaution.

The measures are being taken to prevent the virus spreading during the busy Lunar New Year this week.

Chinese health authorities have urged people in the city of Wuhan to avoid large crowds and public gatherings.
