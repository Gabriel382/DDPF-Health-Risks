LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Copper prices fell to a two-week low on Wednesday as the death toll from the Wuhan virus outbreak climbed and deepened concerns over the potential damage to economic growth and metals demand.

Chinese authorities said on Wednesday the virus had claimed a total of nine lives with 440 confirmed cases as authorities stepped up efforts to control the outbreak.

Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 0.3% to $6,142 a tonne by 1115 GMT, after touching its lowest since Jan. 8 at $6,128.

“The concerns about the coronavirus has been negative for base metals,” said Capital Economics analyst Kieran Clancy, adding that there were concerns that the outbreak would claim more lives and hit global markets as it did in 2003.

“If the virus fails to translate into a big and negative factor then we will see most of this move in metals prices reversed.”

Meanwhile, rising inventories of copper in LME-approved warehouses continued to weigh on prices. Headline stocks rose 20% to 195,375 tonnes, their highest since Dec. 5. MCUSTX-TOTAL

In the previous session, data from the bourse showed stocks jumped by a third.

SPREADS: The discount of the LME cash contract over the three-month contract was near its highest since early October, at $33.50. This pointed to plentiful immediate supply of copper. CMSN0-3

COPPER SUPPLY: Antofagasta Plc on Wednesday reported a 5.8% drop in fourth-quarter copper production due to nationwide civil unrest in Chile. But it still managed to record an annual record in output.

COPPER PRICES: An easing in the U.S.-China trade dispute could push copper prices to the high $6,000’s in 2020, Eurasian Resources Group Chief Executive Benedikt Sobotka said on Tuesday in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.

ALUMINIUM: Indonesian state-owned smelting company PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium will raise its annual smelter capacity to a million tonnes from its current 250,000 tonnes in the next six to seven years, its managing director said.

NICKEL: The global nickel market deficit tightened to 1,266 tonnes in November from a shortfall of 3,077 tonnes in the previous month, the International Nickel Study Group said.

ZINC SPREAD: The premium of LME cash zinc to the three-month contract MZN0-3 increased to $23.75 a tonne, its highest since Nov. 29, indicating tighter availability of LME supplies.

“Physical demand on aluminium and zinc is better than normal for the pre-Chinese New Year season,” a trader said, pointing to a contango in aluminium and high premiums of long-term zinc contracts.

PRICES: Aluminium was steady at $1,825.50 a tonne, zinc was slightly up at $2457.50, lead gained 0.6% to $1,972.50, tin to added 0.3% to $17,630 while nickel rose 0.7% to $13,630 a tonne after touching a six-week trough.
