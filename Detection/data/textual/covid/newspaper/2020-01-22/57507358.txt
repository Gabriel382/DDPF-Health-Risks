Today the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a Watch Level 2 Alert (Practice Enhanced Precautions) for an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia first identified in Wuhan, China, caused by a new strain of coronavirus that has infected over 400 people and caused nine deaths in China.  
The virus known as 2019-nCoV has spread quickly in China. A number of countries, including the United States, are screening travelers arriving from Wuhan and have confirmed cases in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. Yesterday, the United States confirmed its first case of the coronavirus in a passenger that had arrived from Wuhan last week.
This new coronavirus has been linked to a Wuhan seafood and wildlife market, which has been closed since January 1 to prevent further spread of the illness. Health officials originally thought the coronavirus spread from animal-to-person. But on Monday, Chinese health officials confirmed on state TV that person-to-person is also happening, leading to increased anxiety. 
Bloomberg has reported that fear of contracting the illness has caused a high demand for face masks and hand sanitizer across China. At one drugstore in a Shanghai mall, customers lined up to wait for a new shipment of face masks, which sold out in 30 minutes. 
In its new travel alert, the CDC advises that travelers to Wuhan City should avoid contact with sick people and avoid contact will all animals, dead or alive. In addition, the CDC says that older adults with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe disease.
