ASX to drop from record high as investors cash out amid China virus outbreak 
 Australian shares are expected to drop from their record highs as investors lock in recent gains amid concerns of China's deadly virus outbreak spreading beyond its borders.

By 9:00am (AEDT), ASX futures were down 15 points, or 0.2 per cent.

This was despite a positive lead from Wall Street, which traded at their highest levels ever — before pulling back sharply in the final hour of trade.

The industrial-skewed Dow Jones index fell by 10 points (practically flat) to 29,186. It had lifted by as much as 120 points earlier in the session.

The benchmark S&P 500 was largely unchanged, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lifted by 0.1 per cent.

US investors initially shrugged off their contagion fears as technology giants like IBM reported a stronger-than-expected profit, which led to its share price jumping 3.1 per cent.

On the flipside, video streaming giant Netflix warned investors of tougher conditions in the months ahead and its share price plunged by 3.9 per cent.

"Certainly, the market is spooked by it [the coronavirus infections]," said Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.

Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was steady at 68.4 US cents.

Spot gold has lifted to $US1,559 ounce, while Brent crude oil dropped sharply to $US62.68 per barrel.

In economic news, the Bureau of Statistics will release its December job figures, and many economists predict Australia's unemployment rate will rise back to 5.3 per cent.
