Rupee opens higher at 71.13 per dollar 
 The Indian rupee gained in the early trade on January 22. It opened higher by 8 paise at 71.13 per dollar versus Tuesday's close of 71.21.

On January 21, the Indian rupee ended 10 paise lower at 71.21 against the US dollar amid concerns over IMF revising downwards India's growth forecast and weak quarterly earnings.

Gold prices fell on Wednesday, as the dollar firmed and investors assessed the risk of a global epidemic from a coronavirus outbreak from China that could have an impact on economic growth.

Oil prices also edged lower, extending the previous session's drops, as investors continue to shrug aside the impact of almost all of Libya's crude production being off-line amid plentiful supplies elsewhere.
