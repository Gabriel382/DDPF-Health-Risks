China to shut down public transportation in Wuhan, the epicenter of deadly coronavirus, in attempt to contain mysterious infection 
 Chinese authorities plan to suspend all public transportation in Wuhan — a city of 11 million people that has become the epicenter of a mysterious new virus — in a major step aimed at curbing the deadly outbreak. The temporary shutdown, scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Thursday, includes outbound trains and planes as well as the city bus and ferry system, according to state-run news outlet China Daily.The remarkable announcement comes hours after 11 new deaths related to the virus were confirmed in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, bringing the death toll to 17. As of Wednesday, the newly discovered coronavirus has sickened more than 540 people in China, but a few cases have been confirmed outside the country, including one in the U.S.The outbreak is raising fears of a potentially massive epidemic and drawn similarities to SARS, another type of coronavirus that originated in China in the early 2000s and killed about 800 people in more than a dozen countries.

The Chinese city at the centre of a SARS-like virus outbreak has urged people to stay away, cancelling a major Lunar New Year event, as it strives to contain a disease that has spread across the country.The World Health Organization convened a group of experts Wednesday to consider whether the new virus should be declared a global health emergency.The first cases of the illness are linked to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, though health officials have since learned that the virus can spread from human to human.The first U.S. case was confirmed Tuesday in Washington State, where a Snohomish County man who recently traveled to China was diagnosed with the virus this week. Authorities said he has been isolated as an abundance of caution and is expected to recover. Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Thailand have all confirmed at least one case each and Mexico was investigating a possible case Wednesday.
