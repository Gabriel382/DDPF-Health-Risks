MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 22nd January, 2020) Australian health authorities took a number of measures to counter the risk of a spread of a new type of coronavirus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday.
"Our National Incident Response Centre has been activated and is helping coordinate our response [to the possible threat of the coronavirus] with Commonwealth medical experts working together with states and territories," Morrison tweeted.
The prime minister also said that the threat of virus transmission in Australia remained low but was "evolving.
" Morrisson added that Australians should be on alert but not alarmed as the country had "the best health system in the world."
