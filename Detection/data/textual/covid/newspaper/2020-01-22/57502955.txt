SINGAPORE — Three more suspected cases with pneumonia have been admitted for further assessment and treatment as well as isolated as a precautionary measure here, as the spread of a Wuhan coronavirus widens across China and other parts of the world.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday (22 January) that it was notified of these cases – a 3-year-old male Chinese national, a 4-year-old male Chinese national, and a 78-year-old female Singapore resident – as of 4pm.

The trio – all of whom have travelled to mainland China – remain in stable condition.

Previously, seven suspected cases in Singapore have been declared negative of the new coronavirus strain, which belongs to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

The latter, which also started in China, killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-2003 outbreak.
