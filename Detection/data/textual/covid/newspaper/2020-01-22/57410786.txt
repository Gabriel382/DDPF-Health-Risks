Coronavirus outbreak in China rises to 440 cases with 9 deaths 
 China has confirmed 440 people are infected nationwide with a new coronavirus, with the number of deaths rising to nine, as the US reported its first confirmed case of the mystery disease.

The latest count was current as of midnight on Tuesday, with all deaths in Hubei province, where the first illnesses were reported in December, said Li Bin, deputy director of China’s national health commission.

The outbreak is believed to have originated in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, and causes fever and breathing difficulties. Health officials have confirmed human-to-human transmission, and cases have spread to other Chinese cities and abroad.

China's National Health Commission admitted that the country was now at the "most critical stage" of control and warned that the virus could mutate and spread further.

"Though the transmission route of the virus is yet to be fully understood, there is a possibility of virus mutation and a risk of further spread of the epidemic," Li Bin said on Wednesday.
