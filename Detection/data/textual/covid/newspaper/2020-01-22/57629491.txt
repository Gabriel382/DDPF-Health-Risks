The SP 500 and the Nasdaq closed barely in the black after approaching, then backing down from record highs the day after virus fears prompted a sell-off. The Dow closed nominally lower. 
“The market’s had a big run, that’s made some investors a bit skittish, cautious,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “So we’re not seeing a really strong day.”  
“Earnings season is always volatile and unpredictable,” Ghriskey added. “Every new earnings report that gets released is another piece of the puzzle.”  
Optimism was boosted by International Business Machines (IBM.N), which posted surprise quarterly revenue growth and forecast higher-than-expected full-year profit. Its shares advanced 3.4%. 
Chipmakers rose following a strong forecast from Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holding NV (ASML.AS).

Of the 11 major sectors in the SP 500, six ended the session in positive territory. Tech .SPLRCT was up the most, while energy .SPNY was the biggest laggard.

Streaming pioneer Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) acknowledged stiffer competition in the United States, where quarterly growth fell short of analyst estimates. Its shares closed down 3.6%. 
Shares of Boeing Co (BA.N) extended their fall, dropping 1.4% in the wake of the planemaker’s announcement that it does not expect approval for its 737 MAX aircraft to return to service until summer.
