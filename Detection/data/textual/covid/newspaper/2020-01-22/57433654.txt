Chinese Health Official Says New Form of Coronavirus Could Mutate, Spread Further 
 Li informed reporters that the number of confirmed cases of the novel strain of coronavirus in China has reached 440. Nine people have died as a result of the virus, he added.

Cases of pneumonia caused by the coronavirus have been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and the United States, primarily carried by those who have traveled from Wuhan. Countries around the world have stepped up screening procedures at international airports in preparation for an expected influx of Chinese tourists during the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays.
