Russia Developing Vaccine Against Coronavirus Detected in China - Head of Consumer Welfare Agency 
 Russia is developing a vaccine against the coronavirus detected in China, the head of the Russian Consumer Welfare Agency said.

This comes amid the continuing spread of the new coronavirus which was first detected in China earlier this month and has already claimed the lives of nine people; over 400 others are currently in hospital.Â The virus has also been registered in the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Japan.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) is holding an emergency meeting on Wednesday amid fears that the new virus may turn into a pandemic.

According to China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus is transmitted from person to person through coughing or sneezing.

In 2002, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also emerged from China, killed 800 people around the globe.
