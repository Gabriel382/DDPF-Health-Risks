Experts do not yet know how or when the virus became infectious to people, but they believe the first cases were transmitted by an animal.
The virus causes severe lung disease in the infected.
Coronaviruses can cause symptoms ranging from a mild cold all the way through to death.
This new virus appears to be somewhere in the middle, according to experts, and pneumonia is being reported as a common illness associated with the virus. 

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which is caused by a coronavirus, killed 774 of the 8,098 people infected in an outbreak that started in China in 2002.
Dr Josie Golding, from the Wellcome Trust, said: “There is a strong memory of Sars, that’s where a lot of fear comes from.
“But we’re a lot more prepared to deal with those types of diseases.”
At the moment, there is no vaccine that can protect people against it, but researchers are looking to develop one.
