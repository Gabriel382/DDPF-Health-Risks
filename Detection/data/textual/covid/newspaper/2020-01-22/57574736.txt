The deadly coronavirus outbreak in China could reach Britain because borders are too 'porous' to keep the infection out, experts have said. At a briefing in central London, virologists warned that some 4,000 people were probably now infected in the city of Wuhan, but said it could be as many as 9,700. There have been 460 confirmed cases so far, and nine deaths, putting the fatality rate on par with the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic, which wiped out 50 million people globally. And one expert said he could not rule out that the virus is already in the UK. Today, the Department of Health announced all direct flights from Wuhan to Britain will be met by Port Health teams to check for symptoms of coronavirus.

So what are the symptoms and how does the virus spread? Sarah Newey explains everything you need to know. Anne Gulland examines the mystery new disease which has put scientists on high alert and outlines which countries have been affected so far across the globe.
