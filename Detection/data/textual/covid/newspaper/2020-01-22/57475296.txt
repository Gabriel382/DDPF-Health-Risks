Crude oil futures slip over surplus supply despite Libya outage 
 Crude oil futures slipped 1.77 to Rs 4,138 per barrel on January 22 as participants increased their short position as seen by open interest. Investors also shrugged off the impact of almost all of Libya's crude production being off-line amid plentiful supplies elsewhere.

International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol, on January 21, at the World Economic Forum, said that a surplus oil supply of one million barrels per day will keep crude prices subdued in the first half of 2020.

Sentiment across global markets took a hit overnight amid concerns over the coronavirus. Oil prices settled back as a well-supplied global market would be able to absorb disruptions that have cut Libya's crude production to a trickle. We expect the recent corrective move to continue till the 12,100 mark, Yes Securities said in a note to clients.
