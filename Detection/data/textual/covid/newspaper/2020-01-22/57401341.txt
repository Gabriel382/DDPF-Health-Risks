GRAINS-Soybeans edge lower, linger near 1-month low 
 SYDNEY, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean futures edged lower on Wednesday, lingering near a one-month low, as traders anxiously awaited signs of confirmation that China will honour its commitment and buy North American beans.

* The most-active soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade were down 0.1% at $9.15-1/4 a bushel by 0116 GMT, having closed down 1.5% on Tuesday when prices hit a Dec. 16 low of $9.15 a bushel.

* Corn futures were up 0.2% at $3.88-1/4 a bushel, having closed down 0.5% in the previous session.

* Wheat futures were down 0.2% at $5.80-1/4 a bushel, having closed up 1.9% on Tuesday.

* China has pledged $12.5 billion worth of U.S. agricultural goods in 2020 and at least $19.5 billion over the 2017 level of $24 billion in 2021.

* Brazil's soybean farmers have harvested only 1.8% of the soybean area so far this season, agribusiness consultancy AgRural said on Monday, reducing the ideal window for planting of the country's second corn that is sowed after the oilseed is collected.

* The U.S. Department of Agriculture said 1.2 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans were inspected for export last week, at the top end of analysts' expectations for 600,000 to 1.2 million tonnes.

* Weekly U.S. export inspections were 345,859 tonnes for corn, below analysts' expectations for 450,000 to 800,000 tonnes, and 435,129 tonnes for wheat, towards the low-end of estimates of 400,000 to 600,000 tonnes.

* The yen was supported while the yuan was on the back foot as investors tried to assess the risk of the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China disrupting the country's economy and trade partners.

* Oil prices edged lower, extending the previous session's drops, as investors continue to shrug aside the impact of almost all of Libya's crude production being off-line amid plentiful supplies elsewhere.

* Wall Street lost ground on Tuesday, backing away from record highs as a viral outbreak from China found its way to U.S. shores and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered its global economic growth forecast.
