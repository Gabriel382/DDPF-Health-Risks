MARKET REPORT: Fresh windfall for Pidgley as Berkeley doles out £1bn 
 Builder Berkeley Group plans to almost double its shareholder payout to £1 billion over the next two years, bringing a £13m windfall for its founder and chairman.

However, news that the developer of upmarket homes has increased the cash distribution by £455m will be a bittersweet moment for Tony Pidgley.

As Berkeley rose 4.4 per cent, or 226p, to 5412p, he will reflect on the £216m of shares he has sold over the past three years leaving him with just over 1.3 per cent of the firm.

Had he held on to the stock it would be worth £80m more today, and would be entitled to a larger tranche of the capital being returned to investors.

Berkeley appears to have increased the payout after a rapid improvement in the outlook for builders in the wake of Boris Johnson's resounding election victory.

This has provided more clarity over Brexit, although a No-Deal exit from the EU could yet derail the sector. Rivals Persimmon (up 0.8 per cent, or 24p, to 3001p) and Taylor Wimpey (1 per centc, or 2.1p, higher at 216.4p) also enjoyed a boost.

On the wider market, the FTSE 100 closed the session down 38.78 points at 7571.92, after waxing and waning most of the day as the coronavirus and Donald Trump's impeachment trial continued to act as a bromide.

The Sars-like outbreak has also put the kibosh on travel and hotel stocks this week, with Anglo-German holiday firm Tui the latest stock casualty. It topped the blue-chip list of losers, ending 5.5 per cent, or 49p, lower at 837p.

Dropping down a division, the FTSE 250's leading riser was investment fund IP Group, which advanced 3 per cent, or 2p, to 69.4p after successfully – and presumably profitably – cashing in a stake in fuel cells specialist Ceres Power.

Proving the old City adage that it's better to travel than arrive, AJ Bell succumbed to profit-taking after an update which revealed that assets under administration on its popular electronic platform rose 27 per cent last year to £47bn. The stock, up a third in the last year, fell 1.2 per cent, or 5p, to 399.5p.

Wetherspoons, down 2 per cent, or 32p, at 1563p had a decent festive period with underlying sales up 4.7 per cent. But the gloss was taken off the performance after the pub chain warned net debt would be slightly higher than forecast.

Among the small-caps, miner Goldplat shot up 48.2 per cent, or 1.3p, to 4p after it said its full-year results will exceed market expectations thanks to higher gold prices. Fellow digger Ariana was also driven 3.6 per cent, or 0.1p, higher to 2.9p following 'exceptional' sample results from its gold project in Turkey.

Biotech Angle climbed 19.5 per cent, or 12.3p, to 76.5p after predicting US clearance for its Parsortix cancer test in the third quarter following a meeting with regulators.

Somero Enterprises tracked up 11 per cent, or 28.5p, to 288.5p after the maker of laser-guided construction equipment upgraded its full-year financial forecasts.

One of the day's biggest casualties was Tissue Regenix, which shed 27.1 per cent, or 0.47p, to 1.27p after it spooked investors by saying it was looking at fundraising options. Publishing house Dods Group tumbled 13.7 per cent, or 0.65p, to 4.1p as it warned the UK's election and an 'uncertain political and economic environment' had led to a slow start to its fourth quarter.

UK uncertainty was also blamed for challenging trading at masonry group Forterra, which dropped 5.1 per cent, or 18p, to 337p after forecasting that first-half profits will be lower than last year.
