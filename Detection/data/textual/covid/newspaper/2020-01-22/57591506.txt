What is coronavirus and should I be worried? Here’s what we know | ABC News 
 It started as a few cases of pneumonia in workers at a fish market in central China. Now a new virus has the world on alert.



Late December 2019, doctors began seeing a new type of viral pneumonia — fever, cough, difficulty breathing — in people who worked at or visited a seafood market in the suburbs of Wuhan in China.



Since then, hundreds more cases have been reported and a handful of people have died.



On Tuesday, it was confirmed a Brisbane man was in isolation in his home as Queensland Health authorities ran tests on whether he was carrying the new strain. Australian airports are ramping up their screening procedures of passengers arriving from China.



Cases have also been reported in the United States, Thailand and Japan, among others.



So what do we know about the novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, and how worried should we be? Here’s what you need to know.
