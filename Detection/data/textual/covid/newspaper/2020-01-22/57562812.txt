Death toll from Chinese coronavirus outbreak nearly doubles 
 The death toll from China’s deadly mystery virus has nearly doubled in less than 24 hours — with the number of fatalities climbing to 17 on Wednesday, according to reports.

The Chinese province of Hubei has confirmed 17 deaths and more than 444 total cases of the coronavirus, which emerged in the capital of Wuhan, state TV reported around 8 p.m. local time Wednesday.

The number of deaths linked to the flu-like virus previously had been reported as nine, all of which were in the Hubei province.

The flu-like virus — which is transmitted between humans — has been detected in five countries, including the US, where officials confirmed a case in Washington state on Tuesday.
