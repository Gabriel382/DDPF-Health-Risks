Killer Chinese coronavirus is 'probably' on its way to Britain 
 The killer Chinese coronavirus that is sweeping the world could already be in Britain, health experts have warned today.

Leading scientists admitted there may already be a mild case because screening in the UK 'is not foolproof'.

In another worrying development to the outbreak, researchers have predicted up to 10,000 patients in Wuhan may already have the virus.

Imperial College London experts last week predicted just 1,700 residents in the city at the centre of the outbreak had the virus.

But the team has now upgraded their estimate, given how quickly the never-before-seen infection has spread around China and the world.

The US last night recorded its first case of the SARS-like virus which has killed nine people and sickened 456.

Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan have also recorded cases of the infection already. Officials have confirmed it spreads between humans.

Professor Neil Ferguson, the Imperial researcher behind the worrying prediction, did say the UK was not a major travel destination for Wuhan residents.

London is connected to Wuhan – which is home to 11million people – by three direct flights to Heathrow each week.

And Professor Ferguson said 'we can't rule out the possibility', when asked if there could already be a case in the UK.

Speaking at a press briefing by the Science Media Centre, he added: 'Screening in the UK is not foolproof so there could be a mild case.'

Fears of the outbreak were last week stoked by the Imperial team when they warned up to 4,000 patients in Wuhan may have caught the virus.
