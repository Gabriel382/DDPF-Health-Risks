The infectious disease has killed at least 17 people and sickened over 400 others since it was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. On Tuesday, the first case in the United States was confirmed – a person in their 30s in Seattle, Wash., tested positive for coronavirus. The person is in stable condition and poses “very low risk” to the public, officials said.
