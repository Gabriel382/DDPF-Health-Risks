Stock futures edge higher as China moves to contain virus outbreak 
 Futures pointed to a higher start for U.S. stocks Wednesday, with investors appearing to show confidence in efforts by Chinese authorities to contain the outbreak of a potentially deadly flulike virus.

Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average YMH20, +0.31% rose 88 points, or 0.3%, to 29,267, while S&P 500 futures ESH20, +0.44%  gained 12.75 points, or 0.4%, to 3,332.25. Nasdaq-100 futures NQH20, +0.76%  were up 60.5 points, or 0.7%, at 9,230.25.

On Tuesday, the Dow DJIA, -0.52% shed 152.06 points, or 0.5%, to 29,196.04, ending its five-day streak of gains. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.27% fell 8.83 points, or 0.3%, to 3,320.79 and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.19% closed down 18.14 points, or 0.2%, at 9,370.81, after briefly turning positive mid-session to set a record intraday high of 9,397.58.

Major indexes finished lower on Tuesday, pulling back from records seen last week, after a U.S. citizen who had recently returned from a trip to central China was diagnosed with the new virus that’s raised worries over a potential pandemic. But analysts said recent updates from Chinese authorities had provided investors with some comfort the outbreak will be contained.

“It seems that risk sentiment is considering much of the widespread news and talk of a potential SARS 2003 outbreak as predominantly fearmongering, and that the situation will eventually return to normal, as it has historically,” said Bethel Loh, macro strategist at ThinkMarkets, in a note.

“This has driven investors to use yesterday’s broad selloff as an opportunity to get their positioning right well before earnings season gets under way,” Loh said.
