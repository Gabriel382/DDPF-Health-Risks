Hong Kong confirms first coronavirus case 
 Hong Kong on Wednesday confirmed its first case of the mysterious coronavirus, Reuters reports citing multiple local outlets.

The patient reportedly arrived by a high-speed railway from the mainland and has been quarantined at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

The flu-like virus outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and has spread across Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Macau. The first confirmed case in the U.S. was reported Tuesday in Washington state.

Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority enhanced laboratory surveillance for pneumonia cases on Tuesday to include patients with a travel history to all of mainland China, not just Wuhan, according to Reuters.

Hong Kong is taking measures including using temperature screening machinery at airports and high-speed rail stations, and requiring air passengers to fill in health declaration forms, according to Reuters.

The Centers for Disease Control has said it will be screening passengers from Wuhan who arrive at international airports in Atlanta and Chicago; screening began last week for passengers arriving in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The 30-year-old man identified in Washington had recently traveled from Wuhan, according to the CDC.

A top World Health Organization panel is meeting Wednesday to decide whether the virus should be declared a public health emergency of international concern.
