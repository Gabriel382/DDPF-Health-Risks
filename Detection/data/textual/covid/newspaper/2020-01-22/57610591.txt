Oil futures mark lowest settlement since early December 
 Oil futures ended lower on Wednesday, pressured by demand concerns linked to the coronavirus outbreak in China, as well as expectations for a weekly rise in U.S. crude inventories. Weekly data on U.S. petroleum supplies will be released by the American Petroleum Institute later Wednesday, with government figures from the Energy Information Administration due out early Thursday. The data are each delayed by a day this week because of Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expect the EIA Thursday to report an increase of 500,000 barrel in U.S. crude inventories for the week ended Jan. 17. Ahead of the supply data, March West Texas Intermediate oil CLH20, -2.88% fell $1.64, or 2.8%, to settle at $56.74 barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the lowest front-month contract finish since Dec. 3, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
