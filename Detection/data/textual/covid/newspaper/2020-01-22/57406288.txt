China confirms 9 deaths and 440 other infected with killer Coronavirus 
 China has confirmed nine people have died while 440 other in 13 provinces are infected with the killer Coronavirus.

The country's National Health Commission said the number of confirmed cases in changing rapidly.

Vice minister Li Bin said there is evidence of the disease being spread via "respiratory transmission" from patient to patient.

Wuhan, where the virus originated, and Hubei have been tasked with taking the strictest possible measures to stop the illness from spreading.

Public gatherings will be limited, while passengers are already being tested on planes.

The government has already made "effective work on tracking the virus," Minister Li said.

Residents of Wuhan City have been advised not to travel and live animals are not allowed to enter.

Meanwhile, Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Apple supplier Foxconn, said he was advising company employees not to visit China over the coming Lunar New Year holiday, amid concerns over coronavirus.

"The speed of contagion will be no less than SARS," Gou said at the company's Lunar New Year party.

"I advise everyone not to go to the mainland for this coming New Year holiday."

The head of China's Disease Control Centre said they are still learning about the new virus, when asked to compare the deadliness of coronavirus to SARS.

An official for China's National Health Commission said they are taking strict measures in hospitals to protect healthcare workers and stop the virus from spreading further.

The official said they have no evidence of "super spreaders" so far.

While China works to contain the virus, it has already spread with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan confirming one case each.
