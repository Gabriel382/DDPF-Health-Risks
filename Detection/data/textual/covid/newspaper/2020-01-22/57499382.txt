The CDC says that if you have traveled to Wuhan recently and feel any of these symptoms, you should "seek medical care right away."Patients in the US who meet these criteria should be evaluated as a person under investigation for the Wuhan, and reported to their state health department, it added.Who is most at risk?Coronaviruses like 2019-nCoV are particularly dangerous for people who have weakened immune systems, like younger children and older adults.There are no vaccines to protect humans from contracting a coronavirus.Pets are also at risk of catching coronaviruses, which can lead to disease and even death.The outbreak of the Wuhan virus was first identified at a market that sold seafood and live animals like wolves and civet cats.
