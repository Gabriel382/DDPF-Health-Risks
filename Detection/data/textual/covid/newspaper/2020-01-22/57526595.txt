Homeless man filmed teaching rats to perform tricks as he sits on pavement 
 A homeless man has tamed and trained four rats to do tricks while sleeping rough on the streets.

The video – which was first posted to TikTok before exploding on Reddit – shows the man placing four rats on a piece of cloth before raising a finger to guide a brown rat to perform a stunt.

The rodent hops onto his finger and performs a full spin before the man gives it a touch on its forehead.

He then throws another rat further away from the cloth and signals it to run back to him.

All four rats wait patiently and wait for his command until the man gives them a pat on the back.

It is not clear where the video was filmed but has been received more than 48,000 upvotes since being posted to Reddit earlier today.

Web users were quick to comment their amazement at the rats' brilliant tricks.

One said: "Rats are the best pets and so smart! This man obviously treats them well because they clearly love him!"

Another agreed and commented: "Can confirm. Source: I had a rat, and she was absolutely brilliant."

A third even gave him a blessing for good luck as he wrote: "It's about to become the year of the rat for Chinese new year.

"Maybe his talents will give his life a good turn around. Hopefully, he will find warmth during the cold nights."

But others were worried about the diseases the man could have caught, in particular, the uprise of worrying coronavirus.

The deadly virus first broke out in Wuhan, China and has now infected more than 400 people, with reports that this includes 14 health workers and 3 fatalities.
