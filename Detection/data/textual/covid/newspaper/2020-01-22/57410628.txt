London copper hovers around 2-wk low as China virus spreads 
 SINGAPORE, Jan 22 (Reuters) - London copper prices hovered around a two-week low on Wednesday after inventories climbed by a third and as a new strain of coronavirus from China spread further across the world.

The death toll from the flu-like virus in China rose to nine on Wednesday with 440 confirmed cases and the first case was reported in the United States. The virus struck as millions of Chinese prepared to travel for the Lunar New Year, heightening contagion risks.

Benchmark three-month copper on the LME fell as much as 0.5% a tonne to $6,128 a tonne, its lowest since Jan. 8, but later rebounded slightly to being almost unchanged at $6,161.50 a tonne by 0313 GMT. The contract dropped 1.6% in the previous session, its biggest daily loss since Oct. 31.

The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) fell 0.3% to 48,470 yuan ($7,024.23) a tonne.
