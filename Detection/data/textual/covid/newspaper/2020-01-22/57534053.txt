Swiss Franc 
 The Swiss franc weakened against the Dollar and Euro on Wednesday, after expectations that the central bank is stepping up its intervention in the market more than offset worries about China coronavirus spread. Swiss National Bank's data showed the amount of cash that domestic commercial banks hold with the central bank increased last week, pointing to further intervention to stop its currency from appreciating. Weekly deposit data is used as a proxy to estimate how active the central bank has been in the currency market. The Swiss franc hit a 3-year high against the Euro last week. In the morning trade, the currency was 0.3% lower at $0.972 and it decreased 0.2% to EUR1.076. Historically, the Swiss Franc reached an all time high of 4.32 in January of 1971.

The Swiss Franc is expected to trade at 0.98 by the end of this quarter, according to Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations. Looking forward, we estimate it to trade at 0.99 in 12 months time.
