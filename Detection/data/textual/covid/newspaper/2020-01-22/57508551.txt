China coronavirus: How serious is the China virus epidemic? Will the virus spread? 
 How serious is the coronavirus epidemic?
Professor Allen Cheng from the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at Monash University in Australia told Express.co.uk the viral outbreak has shown some similarities to past epidemics.
Between 2002 and 2003, a deadly strain of coronavirus killed 774 people with Severe Scute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS-CoV.
Nearly 8,000 people were infected by the virus, predominantly in East Asia.
Then in 2012, the world stood on the brink of another pandemic when a new strain of coronavirus infected people with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS-CoV.
The epidemiologist, however, said: “It is too early to tell how close this will be to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV outbreaks.”
