London copper hovers near 2-week low amid virus outbreak 
 SINGAPORE, Jan 22 (Reuters) - London copper prices hovered around a two-week low on Wednesday as concerns over a flu-like virus in China weighed and as inventories climbed by a third overnight.

The death toll from the new flu-like coronavirus, started in Wuhan city in China, rose to nine with 440 confirmed cases and the first case was reported in the United States. The virus struck as millions of Chinese prepared to travel for the Lunar New Year, heightening contagion risks.

The World Health Organization was due to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to determine whether the outbreak of the new coronavirus constitutes a global health emergency.

Benchmark three-month copper on the LME fell as much as 0.5% to $6,128 a tonne, its lowest since Jan. 8, but later rebounded to $6,160 a tonne by 0454 GMT. The contract dropped 1.6% in the previous session, its biggest daily loss since Oct. 31, 2019.

The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) fell to as low as 48,280 yuan ($6,995.07) a tonne, its lowest since Dec. 9, 2019 before rising slightly to 48,480 yuan a tonne at the Asian hour midday break.

"Price fell on worries of Wuhan virus crisis. I think the virus situation can be worse. There's no clear picture now," said a base metals trader in Singapore.

* COPPER STOCKS: Copper inventories in warehouses approved by the London Metal Exchange (LME)  surged by 38,700 tonnes to 162,925 tonnes, daily LME data on Tuesday showed.

* OTHER PRICES: LME aluminium dipped 0.1%, nickel rose 0.8%, zinc lost 0.3%, while lead advanced 0.7%. ShFE aluminium fell 0.3%, nickel declined 0.4%, while zinc rose 0.3% and lead decreased 0.6%.

* CHINA STOCKS: The Chinese stock market fell to its lowest so far this year on Wednesday, battered by fears over the virus outbreak.

* NICKEL: The global nickel market deficit tightened to 1,266 tonnes in November from a revised shortfall of 3,077 tonnes in the previous month, the International Nickel Study Group said.

* ZINC SPREAD: The premium of LME cash zinc to the three-month contract  increased to $23.75 a tonne, its highest since Nov. 29, having swung from a discount of $3.50 on Dec. 11. The premium indicates tighter availability of LME supplies.

* "Physical demand on aluminium and zinc is better than normal for the pre-Chinese New Year season," said the Singapore-based trader, pointing to a contango in aluminium and high premiums of long-term zinc contracts.
