S&P 500 and Nasdaq kick off trade at intraday records as stock market shakes of coronavirus-sparked malaise 
 U.S. stocks Wednesday at the open trading solidly higher, with the main benchmarks attempting a fresh assault on all-time highs, as investors tried to shake off worries about an Asian flu outbreak. Chinese authorities assured the public it was taking steps to contain what investors had feared might become a coronavirus pandemic that could threaten economic growth in the region and possibly spill over to other parts of the globe if the virus spread. However, investors appeared to react positively to assurances from President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "It's going to be just fine," the president told CNBC in an interview at the annual conference. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.33% gained about 92 points, or 0.3%, at 29,288, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.38% gained 0.4% to 3,332, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.55% advanced 0.5% to 9,415. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both touched intraday records near Wednesday's start.
