The virus, called 2019-nCoV, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, central China, at the end of 2018. As it is a new strain of coronavirus — which is one that infects the nose, throat, or sinuses — that has not been seen by humans before, scientists are scrambling to understand the treat it.Authorities on Monday said the virus can spread from one human to another, having previously said that they believed it could only spread from animals to humans. Fears that the virus could spread further are heightened as hundreds of millions of Chinese people prepare to travel to mark the weeks-long Chinese New Year celebration — travelling around the country and the world, often in crowded trains and planes.
