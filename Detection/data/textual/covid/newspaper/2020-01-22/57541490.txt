USMAN (Russia) (UrduPoint news / Sputnik - 22nd January, 2020) Russia is developing a vaccine against a mysterious coronavirus that originated in China and already spread to several other countries, Anna Popova, head of the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor) said Wednesday.
"The development of the vaccine, of course, is underway.
 Each time we have a sequence (of a virus), we begin immediately to develop a vaccine," Popova told reporters.
The mysterious type of pneumonia broke out in Wuhan in late December and has since been confirmed by China and the World Health Organization to be a contagious new strain of coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV. At least nine people have died and more than 400 have been infected so far.
The virus has also been registered in the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Japan.
