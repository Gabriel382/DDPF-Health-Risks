Wuhan under quarantine as coronavirus outbreak worsens 
 Chinese state media are reporting the city of Wuhan is under quarantine as the outbreak of coronavirus worsens. Buses, trains, ferries and other long-distance transportation networks will be suspended - airports will also be closed to outgoing passengers. Authorities are asking citizens not to leave unless there are special circumstances, state media reported. The World Health Organisation's boss called it an "evolving and complex situation" and said a decision on whether to declare an international health emergency would be made on Thursday. No cases have been confirmed in Australia but China has confirmed 17 people have now died and more than 400 people have been infected.
