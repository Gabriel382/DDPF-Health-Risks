According to Bloomberg, he was a regular shopper at the Huanan Seafood Market. Wet markets are a breeding ground for disease

The Huanan Seafood Market advertised a variety of live animals, including dogs, peacocks, otters, camels, and koalas, according to The South China Morning Post.Photos posted to social media also suggest the market was selling live wolf pups and civet cats, both of which are eaten in China. —Muyi Xiao (@muyixiao) January 21, 2020These types of markets are popular around China and can be found in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, and Shandong Province.They can also be breeding grounds for viruses. The H7N9 and H5N9 Bird flu were likely transmitted to humans via direct contact with infected poultry at a live bird market in China, according to WHO. The diseases killed a collective 1,000 people globally. And SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed over 700 people on the planet between 2002 and 2003, is also SARS, is also believed to have mutated while spreading through the wet animal markets.Wang Yuedan, a professor of immunology at Peking University's School of Basic Medical Sciences, told Bloomberg that China's preference for fresh and exotic meat "does make China susceptible to the risk of new virus outbreaks through close animal and human contact.""The same is true for Ebola, which came about as a result of eating animals from the forest in Africa," he said.
