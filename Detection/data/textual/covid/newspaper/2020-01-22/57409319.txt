WHO emergency meet LIVE: Is new coronavirus outbreak global threat? UN body to decide today 
 China says the new strain of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has killed nine people, and that 440 people in 13 provinces are carrying infections.
Officials have confirmed the virus can be transmitted between humans, and China says there's evidence of respiratory transmission from patient to patient.
Keep in mind that coronavirus is not the name of a specific species, but rather a class of viruses, including the type that causes SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome).
The WHO hasn't yet recommended curbs on global travel on trade, but all eyes are on today's meeting in Geneva.
Here's a list of standard precautions published by the UN body.
- washing your hands regularly
- covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze
- cooking meat and eggs thoroughly
- Avoiding close contact with people with symptoms of respiratory illness
