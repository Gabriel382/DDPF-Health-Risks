Treasury yields tick higher as stocks shrug off coronavirus worries 
 U.S. Treasury yields edged up on Wednesday as stocks looked likely to shake off fears around the coronavirus’s spread to other countries from China, which helped to pull equity indexes down from records on Tuesday on concerns about a possible pandemic slowing global economic growth.

The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.29%   was up 0.9 basis point to 1.778%, while the 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, -0.01%   edged up 0.4 basis point to 1.536%. The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.10%   was virtually unchanged at 2.233%.

Fears that the coronavirus was at risk of turning into a global pandemic waned after Beijing’s strong response helped to allay concerns. Health officials in China called for an unofficial quarantine of the city Wuhan, where the coronavirus had originated. So far, more than 400 victims and nine deaths have been reported.

Futures for the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.27%   and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.52%   indicated Wall Street was set to renew its record-breaking climb on Wednesday.

In U.S. economic data, investors could see additional signs of strength in the housing sector, with existing home sales for December due for release at 10 a.m. ET.

Last week, U.S. data showed that construction of new homes ran at a 1.61 million annualized pace, a 13-year high, helping to push stock-market benchmarks to records on Friday.

“Treasuries trade well considering the reversal of equity markets higher, on concern regarding the coronavirus lessens, at least for the moment. We cautioned yesterday about not getting too bearish on risk at this point due to the viral outbreak, given even the SARS outbreak seemed to have little impact in the medium term on Asian equity markets back in 2003,” wrote analysts at NatWest Markets.
