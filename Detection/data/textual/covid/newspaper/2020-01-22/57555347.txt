Borders too ‘porous’ to keep coronavirus out of Britain, warn experts 
 The deadly coronavirus outbreak in China could reach Britain because borders are too ‘porous’ to keep the infection out, experts have said.

At a briefing in central London, virologists warned that some 4,000 people were probably now infected in the city of Wuhan, but said it could be as many as 9,700.

There have been 460 confirmed cases so far, and nine deaths, putting the fatality rate on par with the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic, which wiped out 50 million people globally.

Experts said more deaths were expected in the coming days and the World Health Organisation (WHO) is considering declaring an international public health emergency.

The virus is also on the move, with probable cases now detected in Mexico, Hong Kong, the US, Japan, Thailand and South Korea.

On Wednesday the Department of Health announced that all direct flights from Wuhan to Britain will be met by Port Health teams to check for symptoms of coronavirus.
