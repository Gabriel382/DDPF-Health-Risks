The flu is an example of a virus that mutates, and that mutation is why different flu vaccines are needed every year.

"We are still in the process of learning more about this disease," he said.And Li said on Wednesday that that officials believe the virus is mainly spread "through the respiratory tract" and said "there is possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease."China has identified 440 people known to be infected as of midnight on Tuesday — which means the figure has increased nine-fold in just one week.The virus, called 2019-nCoV, is a coronavirus — which is one that infects the nose, throat, or sinuses — and has pneumonia-like symptoms.Li said on Wednesday that the growing number of confirmed cases is at least partly due to greater monitoring efforts and understanding of the virus.Authorities had confirmed earlier this week that the virus, which has been linked to a market selling animals, can be spread from human to human, despite the earlier belief that humans were only able to catch it from animals.Some cases of the virus have spread from the city of Wuhan to other parts of China, and cases have also been confirmed in other countries: The US, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and South Korea.Other countries have reported suspected cases of the virus.
