Wuhan Virus Latest: Official Infection Count Nears 450 as Outbreak Spreads - Caixin Global 
 Since December, health authorities in China have been grappling with an outbreak of viral pneumonia that has sickened hundreds of people and killed nine.

The disease is thought to be caused by a previously unknown type of coronavirus that may have first spread to humans from animals at a now-shuttered seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where most of the cases have been diagnosed. Further cases have been confirmed in Thailand, Japan and South Korea while suspected cases have also occurred in a number of other countries and territories.

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause a variety of ailments, among them the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Most known coronaviruses cause relatively mild cold-like symptoms, but their ability to jump between humans and animals makes them hard to contain. Chinese health officials have confirmed that the new virus can spread between people, but do not believe it to be as serious as SARS or MERS.

Caixin Global will continue covering this story as it develops. Please check back regularly for updates.

• Nine people have now died and the number of confirmed coronavirus cases on the Chinese mainland has climbed to 339, the State Council Information Office said in a morning press conference. There was one case in Macao and one case in Taiwan. A total of 1,394 people are under medical observation.

• Researchers from the German Center for Infection Research have developed and released a rapid diagnostic test for the new virus. It has been published online by the World Health Organization (WHO).

• Coronavirus fears have prompted North Korea to place a temporary ban on foreign tourists, according to a tour operator based in Beijing.

• The WHO is preparing to convene an expert committee in Geneva on Wednesday to determine whether the outbreak constitutes an international health emergency.

• The United States confirmed its first case of infection by the novel coronavirus racing through China. A male patient in his 30s was diagnosed with the virus in Snohomish County, Washington state, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

The patient had recently traveled to Wuhan, where a cluster of infection cases has been reported, and returned Jan. 15 to the U.S. He sought care at a medical facility in Washington after showing pneumonia-like symptoms, according to the CDC. The person is in good condition and isolated “out of caution,” and the case “poses little risk” to the public, a CDC official said.

The CDC said it deployed a team to support the ongoing investigation in Washington, including potentially tracing close contacts to determine whether anyone else has become ill.

The CDC last week started to screen passengers entering the U.S. from Wuhan at three airports: San Francisco, Los Angeles and John F. Kennedy in New York.

• The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China grew to 319, including 270 in Hubei, 10 in Beijing, 17 in Guangdong and six in Shanghai. The death toll reached six, all in Hubei. Outside China, one confirmed case was reported in Japan, two in Thailand and one in South Korea.

• Top health experts warned of potential risks of a so-called “super-spreader” — a patient with stronger infectious power than other patients — in the spread of coronavirus, which will pose greater challenges for epidemic control.

• The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China grew to 291, according to the country’s National Health Commission. That included 270 in Hubei — the province containing Wuhan — two in Shanghai, five in Beijing and 14 in Guangdong.

• Australia said it will start screening passengers arriving on three weekly flights from Wuhan to Sydney, Reuters reported. The news comes after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said travelers arriving from Wuhan will have to undergo screenings at airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

• Shanghai confirmed the first imported coronavirus case Monday night after reporting two suspected cases earlier in the day. The patient, a 56-year-old woman, showed symptoms of fever and fatigue shortly after she arrived at Shanghai from Wuhan, according to the National Health Commission. The patient was admitted to a local hospital and is in stable condition. Two people in close contact with her in Shanghai are under observation, the city’s health authority said.

• Zhong Nanshan, one of China’s best-known epidemiology experts who leads the national health commission team investigating the outbreak, said in an interview (link in Chinese) with the state broadcaster that it is confirmed that the new virus can be passed between people. Health authorities have been reluctant to confirm human-to-human transmission after the pneumonia broke out in Wuhan, where 198 cases have been confirmed.

Zhong said (link in Chinese) human-to-human transmission of the virus has been identified in Wuhan and Guangdong, and 14 medical staff have been affected during treatments.

• Vice Premier Sun Chunlan at a Monday meeting on pneumonia control said the new coronavirus is classified as a Class B infectious disease — the second-most serious level under Chinese law. Sun urged local authorities to enhance control and prevention efforts to stop the spread of the virus.

• Hong Kong said it will require all flight passengers arriving from Wuhan to declare their health conditions starting Jan. 21. The city also ordered doctors and medical institutions to report suspected infection cases to health authorities.

Two people in Daxing, a district in the south of the capital, tested positive for the pathogen, the district health commission said in a statement (link in Chinese). Both patients have a history of travel to Wuhan. They are being treated in quarantine and are in a stable condition, authorities said.

• The southern province of Guangdong confirmed that a 66-year-old man in the city of Shenzhen, which neighbors Hong Kong, had been diagnosed with the virus Sunday. He had also traveled to Wuhan in late December.

• Authorities in East China’s Zhejiang province said five people had been quarantined there since Friday after displaying symptoms of the disease (link in Chinese). The patients are awaiting diagnosis and remain in a stable condition, the provincial health commission said.

• A prominent virologist who helped identify the source of the deadly SARS coronavirus nearly two decades ago told Caixin that Wuhan’s spike in new cases “shows that the (new) virus can spread from person to person.” Guan Yi, who heads a laboratory for emerging infectious diseases at Hong Kong University’s School of Public Health, said that while the virus had seemingly not initially passed between people, the rise in cases over the past several weeks meant “we should no longer be playing word games about whether or not this constitutes human-to-human transmission.”

In 2002 and 2003, a SARS outbreak erupted in Hong Kong and southern China, killing hundreds.

• In a statement Monday, the China office of the World Health Organization (WHO) said the new cases reported over recent days were “not unexpected” and were the result of stepped up disease surveillance efforts. “Given travel patterns, it is possible there will be more new cases,” the U.N. agency said in a statement to Caixin, adding that as more cases are identified, the severity of the disease and how it is transmitted will become clearer.

“WHO urges countries to continue preparedness activities and continue sharing of information,” the statement said. “Speedy information sharing has already had a positive impact on the response.”
