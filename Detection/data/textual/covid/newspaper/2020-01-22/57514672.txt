MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 22nd January, 2020) There is no risk of the newly discovered strain of coronavirus, originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, reaching Turkey, the country's health minister, Fahrettin Koca, said on Wednesday.
"There are currently no patients with the new type of China's coronavirus in Turkey, and there is currently no threat to the country," Koca told the Anadolu news agency.
The minister noted that the country's sanitary and migration services were ready to apply sanitary-quarantine control measures at border crossing points.
The mysterious type of pneumonia broke out in Wuhan in late December and has since been confirmed by China and the World Health Organization to be a contagious new strain of coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV.
 At least nine people have died and more than 400 have been infected so far.
The virus has also been registered in Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Japan.
Meanwhile, countries around the world have stepped up screening procedures at international airports in preparation for an expected influx of Chinese tourists during the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays.
