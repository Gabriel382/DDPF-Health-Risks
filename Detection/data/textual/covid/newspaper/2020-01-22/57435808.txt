Death Toll from China Virus Rises to 9 
 The death toll from a new strain of coronavirus his risen to nine in China as the disease continues to spread throughout the country.


China's National Health Commission announced the latest figure Wednesday, adding that 440 people have been confirmed to be infected with coronavirus.


The number of deaths and confirmed cases rose from six and 318, respectively, from just a day prior.


Concerns are emerging that the virus could spread like SARS, which infected more than eight-thousand people and killed 774 in 37 countries in 2002 and 2003.


CNN quoted an expert from China's National Health Commission who is investigating the virus as saying earlier on Monday that while it is not as serious as SARS, the number of people with the disease was climbing and suggested that the death rate "at the moment is not so representative."


CNN also said a study by researchers in Britain has assessed that the number of infections in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the new coronavirus is believed to have originated, is still grossly underestimated.


The researchers said the real number is closer to 17-hundred, based on the spread of the disease to other cities and countries in a relatively short period of time.
