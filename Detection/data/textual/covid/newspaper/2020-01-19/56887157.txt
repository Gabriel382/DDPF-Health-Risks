China says mysterious SARS-like virus is 'controllable' as 17 new cases emerge ahead of Lunar New Year 
 China has insisted that the outbreak of a SARS-like virus which risks spreading across the country during Lunar New Year celebrations is "controllable", as 17 fresh cases were reported in the city of Wuhan.

In its first statement since the virus was detected, China's National Health Commission said the disease's source was unknown but vowed to "step up monitoring" of any mutations during Chinese New Year period.   Millions of Chinese will be heading home to their families for the holiday, which is also known as the Spring Festival, over the coming days.

The disease, also known as the coronavirus, is alarming because of its connection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong from 2002-2003. Of the 17 new cases in the central city of Wuhan, which is believed to be the epicentre of the outbreak, three were described as "severe." The virus, which has now affected a total of 62 people in Wuhan, has also spread overseas, with two cases reported in Thailand and one in Japan.

Two people have died so far, including a 69-year-old man who succumbed to the disease after it caused pulmonary tuberculosis and damaged his organ functions. Chinese authorities said they had begun "optimised" testing of cases across the city to identify those infected, and said they would begin "detection work ... towards suspected cases in the city" as a next step, as well as carrying out "sampling tests".
