 Japan reports case of mystery virus behind China outbreak

TOKYO: Japan has confirmed a case of a mystery virus that first emerged in China and is from the same family as the deadly SARS pathogen, authorities said Thursday.
It appears to be only the second time the novel coronavirus has been detected outside China, after the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed a case in Thailand.
JapanÂ´s health ministry said a man who had visited the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the apparent epicentre of the outbreak, was hospitalised on January 10, four days after his return to Japan. He reported a persistent fever.
Tests on the patient, who was released from hospital on Wednesday, confirmed he was infected with the new virus.
"This is the first domestic discovery of a pneumonia case related to the new coronavirus," the ministry said in a statement.
"We will continue active epidemiological research while also coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization and related agencies to conduct a risk assessment."
The outbreak has killed one person so far, with 41 patients reported in Wuhan.
The outbreak has caused alarm because the new virus is from the same family as the pathogen that causes SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed 349 people in mainland China and 299 in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003.
Authorities in Wuhan said a seafood market was the centre of the outbreak. It was closed on January 1. Japanese authorities said the man had not visited the market and that it was possible he had been in contact with a person infected with the virus while in Wuhan.
