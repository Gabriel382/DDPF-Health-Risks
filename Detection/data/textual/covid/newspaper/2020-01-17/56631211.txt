3 U.S. airports, including JFK, to screen for virus from China 
 International airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco will screen for a mysterious and potentially fatal virus from China, the Centers for Disease Control said Friday.The screenings for the new strain of coronavirus will take place at the three gateways — including New York’s Kennedy Airport — after Chinese officials reported 45 cases during the outbreak, including two deaths.“This is a serious situation,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a telephone briefing. But she said the risk level to Americans is not currently high.The outbreak appears to have originated from contact between human and animals, according to health officials, but there’s also possible indication it can also be transmitted between people.The strain first emerged in December in Wuhan, a sprawling metropolis in central China home to more than 11 million people. Three additional cases have since been identified outside of China, Messonnier said Friday.Screening will begin in New York on Friday night and in California on Saturday, according to the CDC. It will be conducted on flights into the country from Wuhan.JFK Airport and San Francisco International Airport are the only U.S. cities with direct flights from Wuhan, Dr. Marty Cetron, director of the CDC’s division of global migration and quarantine, said in the Friday briefing. Los Angeles International Airport was included because flights indirectly connect the city to Wuhan.The screenings begin a week ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year, which arrives Jan. 25.Health officials said the screening could include as many as 5,000 people at the trio of airports during the next couple of weeks.
