Second Person in China Dies After Exposure to Mysterious Virus 
 “At the moment, 41 cases of infection of the new coronavirus have been registered, with 12 people having been released from hospitals. Five people remain in critical condition, two people have died, and others are in stable condition”, the Healthcare Department said in a statement.

The second victim is a 69-year-old man who died on Wednesday. The first fatal case was reported on 11 January.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has vowed to closely monitor the possible spread of the coronavirus in China and across the world as Chinese people will actively travel during the country's upcoming Lunar New Year holidays in late January.

The Japanese Health Ministry earlier announced the first detected case of the Chinese coronavirus in the country, contracted by a man who had visited the city of Wuhan.
