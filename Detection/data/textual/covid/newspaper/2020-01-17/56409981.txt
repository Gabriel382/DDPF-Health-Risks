Coronavirus: second death in China after Sars-like outbreak 
 A second person has died from pneumonia in the central Chinese city of Wuhan after an outbreak of a previously unknown virus, local health authorities have said.

The 69-year-old man had been admitted to hospital with abnormal renal function and severe damage to multiple organs, the Wuhan municipal health commission announced. He died on 15 January.

In all 41 cases of pneumonia have been reported in Wuhan, which preliminary lab tests cited by state media showed could be from a new type of coronavirus, a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars).

On Thursday Japan confirmed a man in his 30s had been infected with the virus, and a Chinese woman was quarantined in Thailand with a mystery strain of coronavirus. The World Health Organisation (Who) has warned a wider outbreak is possible.

In Wuhan 763 people have been put under observation after coming into close contact with known patients, health authorities have said. Of these 644 had been released and 119 were still being monitored.

The first confirmed fatality was a 61-year-old man in Wuhan who died of pneumonia after testing positive for the virus.

The outbreak comes ahead of the lunar new year holiday in late January, when many of Chinaâ€™s 1.4 billion people travel to their home towns or abroad.

Memories remain fresh in Asia of a 2002-03 outbreak of Sars which emerged in China and killed nearly 800 people around the world.
