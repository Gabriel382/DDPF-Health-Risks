Martenson Fumes: The W.H.O. Just Prioritized Money Over Human Life 
 Yesterday, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) declared that the Wuhan coronavirus is indeed now a pandemic.

Well...not if you kept listening. The W.H.O. then proceeded to downplay the risk to public health and took pains to make it clear it doesn’t recommend placing restrictions on global trade & travel at this time.

What?!? When we may be in dealing with a viral outbreak as (or more!) virulent than the Spanish Flu? (aka The Great Influenza)

Folks, this is nothing less than a political decision to keep business/commerce flowing without regard to public health.

As an aside, this is not the first time that WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has potentially not told the 'whole truth'. As The NY Times reports, he was accused in 2017 of covering up three cholera epidemics in his home country, Ethiopia, when he was health minister.
