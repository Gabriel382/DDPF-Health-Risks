Two Thai Citizens Charged for Sharing ‘Fake News’ Posts on Coronavirus 
 Thai Digital Economy and Society Minister Buddhipongse Punnakanta told AFP that an unidentified man and woman were recently charged with violating Thailand’s computer crimes act for separate social media posts about the coronavirus that has left 171 dead in China and infected at least 8,000 people around the world.

"They already admitted that they created fake news," Buddhipongse said, AFP reported, also noting that additional suspects are being investigated over their potential spreading of false information.

At least 14 cases of the virus have been detected in Thailand, making it the country with the second-highest number of cases after China.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also confirmed Thursday the first case of person-to-person transmission of the virus within the US.

The spread of the Wuhan coronavirus has been compared to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, which was first reported in Asia back in 2003 and was caused by a similar coronavirus. It spread to 37 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing 774 in 2003 over a six-month-period before being contained. The Wuhan coronavirus has already infected some 8,000 people in about a month’s time.
