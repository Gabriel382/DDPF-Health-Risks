University apologizes for saying xenophobia is 'common reaction' to coronavirus spread 
 The University of California, Berkeley apologized on Thursday evening for an Instagram posting that listed xenophobia and “fears about interacting with those who might be from Asia” as a common reaction to the spread of coronavirus.

The post has since been deleted following an outcry online.

The image, uploaded to the university’s heath services account, sought to explain how to “manage fears and anxiety” about the spread of the highly contagious illness now listed by the World Health Organization as a global public health emergency.

Among the expected reactions listed, which included “anxiety, worry, panic” the posting described: “Xenophobia: fears about interacting with those who might be from Asia and guilt about these feelings”.

“The post has been taken down and we regret any misunderstanding it may have caused,” Roqua Montez, executive director of communications and media relations at Berkeley, told CBS News.

Students and alumni had slammed the image on social media, pointing to the fact that the campus has a large Asian-American student population.

The US state department has now warned Americans to avoid all travel to China due to the rapid spread of the disease, which has claimed over 200 lives in China and infected over 9,700 people. Six people have now been confirmed with the disease in the US, as the UK confirmed its first two coronavirus on Friday.
