Man United hold talks with Carrasco but his first choice is Atletico 
 Manchester United have turned to Yannick Carrasco to improve their attacking options but the Belgium international wants a return to Atletico Madrid.

Carrasco wants a move to Europe from Rafa Benitez’s Dalian Yifang, with the start of Chinese Super League indefinitely suspended due to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Carrasco, 26, also needs to play regularly to be involved in Roberto Martinez’s Euro 2020 plans with Belgium.

Benitez is willing to let him go Atletico boss Diego Simeone is asking for a No 9 rather than an attacking wide player.

And as it is unclear whether the Madrid club will come through on Friday, Carrasco’s representatives have been also held talks Manchester United, who have a historic interest in the player.

As a loan it might just work in strengthening the United squad but he’s not the No.9 Solskjaer - and seemingly everyone else - really wants.

Carrasco is in Europe right now and is, in theory, heading out to Spain for pre season next week with Dalian.
