Philippines' President Orders Travel Ban on Chinese Nationals From Hubei - Spokesman 
 The ban, which will last "until the threat is over", may be expanded to other areas with confirmed coronavirus cases, Panelo added. The possible expansion will depend on the announcements of the Chinese government and the World Health Organization.

Earlier this week, the Philippines suspended tourist visa issuance for Chinese nationals.

The new strain of coronavirus was first detected last December in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province, and has since spread to 19 countries.

The epidemic has already left 213 people dead and over 9,000 infected in China.
