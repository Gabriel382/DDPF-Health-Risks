New Chinese Envoy Arrives with Mask 
 New Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming arrived at Incheon International Airport on Thursday wearing a surgical mask in line with coronavirus precautions, as did accompanying staff.

A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy said Xing also had his temperature checked at the airport.

Xing told reporters on arrival he would "try hard" to assist with the evacuation of Koreans from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.

"I'm very glad to work in South Korea again," he said. "Though we have an issue to handle for the time being, I will look forward to the future and try hard."

It is unclear whether he meant coronavirus or something else, like the U.S. deployment of a THAAD anti-missile battery here.

Xing answered questions in Korean since he is a graduate of North Korea's Sariwon College of Agriculture, which was a training hub for the Chinese Foreign Ministryâ€™s Korea experts.

He was posted to Pyongyang twice, from 1988 to 1991 and from 2006 to 2008, and to Seoul three times in 1992-1995, 2003-2006, and 2008-2011.

His last job was ambassador to Mongolia.
