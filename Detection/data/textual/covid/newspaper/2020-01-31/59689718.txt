Delta, American Airlines to suspend flights to China amid coronavirus outbreak 
 Delta and American Airlines announced Friday they plan to halt all flights to and from mainland China as the number of coronavirus cases in that country jumped from about 800 to nearly 10,000 in a week.American Airlines said the temporary suspension is effective immediately and will continue through at least March 27. Delta will suspend all operations from Monday to at least April 30, the company said in a statement.Both airlines, which had already reduced service to China, said they will continue to monitor the situation and will make adjustments if necessary. The announcements come a day after the U.S. Department of State advised Americans against all travel to China and recommended those who are still in the country to consider departing immediately.Chinese authorities on Friday said the newly discovered virus has killed at least 213 people and sickened about 9,700 others, with the vast majority of cases reported in the central province of Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, which is considered the epicenter of the outbreak. The pneumonia-like infection has spread to more than a dozen other countries, including the U.S., where six patients have been diagnosed with the illness in the past few days. All but one of them had recently traveled to Wuhan. The sixth person contracted the virus from his wife, a Chicago woman who had just returned from that Chinese city.
