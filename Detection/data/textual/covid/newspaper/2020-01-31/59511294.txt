Coronavirus outbreak: State department issues ‘do not travel’ advisory for China 
 The State Department on Thursday told Americans to not travel to China because of the deadly coronavirus outbreak in the country.

The agency issued a “level four” “do not travel” advisory because of the virus, which has infected 9,600 people in the nation and killed 213.

“On January 30, the World Health Organization has determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” the State Department wrote in the advisory.

“Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China,” they added.

The total number of people in China infected by the virus has surpassed those stricken by SARS in the 2002 and 2003 outbreaks, according to the World Health Organization.

“Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus,” the State Department wrote Thursday.
