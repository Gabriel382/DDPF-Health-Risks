Dow transports take a unanimous dive, as coronavirus fears weigh 
 Transportation stocks were suffering broad declines Friday, as concerns that the fast-spreading coronavirus would weigh on the global economy and travel. The Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, -2.15% sank 250 points, or 2.3%, with all 20 components losing ground, to underperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.50%, which shed 468 points, or 1.6%, with 26 of 30 components falling. The Dow transports' biggest loser was Kirby Corp.'s stock KEX, -6.00%, which tumbled 6.3% after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Benjamin Nolan downgraded the diesel engine and marine products company to hold from buy, a day after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations and provided a downbeat 2020 outlook. Among other more-active transport components, shares of American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, -3.23% slid 3.4% and Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, -2.29% dropped 2.6%, amid concerns over travel restrictions.
