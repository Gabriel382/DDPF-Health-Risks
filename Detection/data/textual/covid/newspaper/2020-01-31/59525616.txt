Novel coronavirus PUIs to receive PhilHealth coverage 
 MANILA, Philippines — Filipinos who would be considered a person under investigation (PUI) for novel coronavirus will be given coverage by the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth), Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Friday.

The PhilHealth board convened on Thursday where it decided to provide a novel coronavirus package, Duque said.

“The package is about P1,000 per day for the hospital that takes care of a patient with novel (coronavirus), even if not confirmed or under investigation,” he said.

“PhilHealth will pay the hospitals… if pneumonia sets in, there’s a pneumonia package — mild 16,000 to severe 32,000,” Duque added.

The Department of Health has already confirmed the first case of novel coronavirus in the Philippines, while the number of PUIs has climbed to 31.

On Thursday the DOH  announced a 38-year-old Chinese woman, who arrived in the Philippines through a flight from Hong Kong last week, tested positive for novel coronavirus, which first broke out in the capital city of Wuhan in Hubei province.
