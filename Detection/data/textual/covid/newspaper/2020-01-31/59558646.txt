Hontiveros slams Duterte gov’t for slow banning of Chinese tourists in PH 
 PANGLAO ISLAND, Bohol –– Sen. Risa Hontiveros on Friday lashed at the Duterte administration for being slow in temporarily prohibiting Chinese tourists to the Philippines.

“I can’t understand why the response of our government is so slow. It should not be just a reaction. It should be used as a precautionary measure,” she said.

Hontiveros was in Bohol on Friday morning to discuss the Safe Spaces Act and Mental Health Law organized by an advocacy group.

On her arrival at the Bohol Panglao International Airport, Hontiveros wore a mask along with other tourists.

She said the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared coronavirus an international health emergency, a day after the Philippines on Thursday confirmed its first case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Hontiveros said she already urged the government to temporarily ban Chinese tourists from Wuhan but now it would be better to temporarily ban all tourists from China for 30 days.

Some Boholanos were also worried and slammed the slow decision of the government to ban Chinese nationals. Most of them used the hashtags #protectthePhilippines #protectBohol” in their posts on Facebook.

“Remember, this is just temporary. Why take the risk when it comes to the health and lives of everyone?” said Tagbilaran City resident Joy Bonita Sevilla.

Bohol 2nd district Rep. Erico Aristotle Aumentado had already filed a resolution to impose an immediate travel moratorium on flights from China to Bohol.

The effect of the nCoV was felt by a number of travel operators and resort owners, who received booking and tour cancelations from China.

Miraflor Lawangon, 45, proprietor of Wow Bohol Travel and Tours, said she had anticipated the cancelations.

“Somehow we are expecting that this will affect our business, and it will hurt the tourism industry in Bohol,” she said./lzb
