Britain is standing at a critical junction in history as it leaves the EU 
 At 11pm last night we waved goodbye to our 47-year membership of the EU.

Many will embark on this uncertain journey with optimism, others with trepidation, but everyone realises this is a decisive moment.

The immediate task is to secure a new trade deal with the European Union which protects jobs and business.

There must be no undermining of environmental and consumer protections or chipping away at hard-won workers’ rights.

We also need to strike new trade agreements with dozens of other countries including the United States, Australia, India and Japan.

In this instance no-deal would be better than a bad deal if it meant giving US firms access to the NHS or allowed America to export its chlorinated chicken and hormone-pumped beef to these shores.

Having “taken back control”, Boris Johnson’s Government must build a fairer Britain which spreads wealth more evenly and leaves no area of Britain behind.

The “levelling up” he promises would not be necessary if the Conservatives had not waged a war of austerity which has hollowed out communities and starved vital services.

Mr Johnson claims this is a moment to improve lives in every corner of the UK.

The Mirror will be watching to make sure the Prime Minister makes good on his word.

THE coronavirus came to our shores yesterday with the confirmation that two people have tested positive for the ­potentially deadly virus.

This will be an anxious time for the patients and the 83 Britons in quarantine after being flown back from Wuhan yesterday.

They should be reassured that despite the rapid spread of the virus, the global death toll is so far mercifully below any worst scenario.

While we should be watchful, we should also remember that the NHS is well prepared for dealing with infectious outbreaks and that so far the authorities have acted with diligence and professionalism
