Man Utd want one transfer before 11pm deadline tonight after signing Bruno Fernandes 
 “We’ll get there, we’ll add players. The culture here… character, attitude. Today the quality wasn’t great, sometimes that happens.
“We need more goalscorers, more goals, that’s a definite. We need someone who wants to break their nose or toe to score. 
“It doesn’t always have to be nice goals. We know that.
“We’re challenging them, I need to challenge them more, because we can’t just score nice goals.”
Slimani, Rondon and Ighalo could all be available on a temporary basis with the latter pair currently plying their trade in the Chinese Super League.
The start of the Chinese top flight's new season has been postponed due to the coronavirus epidemic currently engulfing the country.
And that could mean United are able to agree a deal in which Rondon or Ighalo move to Old Trafford for a few months before returning to the Far East.
