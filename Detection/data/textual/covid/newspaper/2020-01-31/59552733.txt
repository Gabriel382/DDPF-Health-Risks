Vietnam carrier Vietjet to suspend flights to China from February 1 
 HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese carrier Vietjet will suspend all flights to and from China from Feb. 1 over coronavirus concerns, the company said on Friday.  
“Vietjet has already planned to suspend all of its flights to China,” it said in a statement. “The suspension is effective from February 1.” 
On Thursday, Vietnam said it would stop issuing visas for Chinese tourists after the Southeast Asian country detected three new cases of the virus.
