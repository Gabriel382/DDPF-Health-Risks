Coronavirus; Govt to Be Selective in Food Imports from China 
 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Trade Minister Agus Suparmanto said that he would be selective in accepting imported goods from China, especially food and beverage commodities as an effort to prevent the entry of coronavirus through food ingredients into Indonesia.“Exports as a whole will not be affected, but [we] must be careful with imports, especially related to foods and beverages. It means we are also selective," Agus said in Surabaya, East Java, on Friday, January 31, 2020.Agus, who was met during his inspection of prices of basic necessities at Wonokromo Market, said that he could not immediately suspend the imports of foods and beverages from China, as any import bans would harm the importers who had made an agreement.Therefore, Agus believes it is necessary to think of a good solution for all parties, even if there is a slight decline in import value.“Yes, we still have to anticipate these things, at least those who have ordered will now definitely rethink and reduce," he said.In regard to rocketing garlic prices in several markets, which is allegedly attributable to the absence of imports, Agus claimed that he had not received any report. “Up to now we have not received any report related to the garlic problem, so if it is needed to take imports and it has been readied, we will carry it out," he said.According to Agus, in general, prices of a number of staple goods remained stable although there were indeed some slight increases as they were related to stocks. In spite of this, Agus remained optimistic the prices would gradually decline by organizing market operations in of regions. “Especially chili, which is now rather expensive because it is the rainy season, it will soon be stable. Just as with chicken eggs, and meat, I see the prices being stable and the prices are below the highest retail reference price," he said. ANTARATranslator: Dio Suhenda
