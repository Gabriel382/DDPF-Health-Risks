U.S. and California health officials confirmed the seventh U.S. case of the coronavirus that has sickened about 10,000 people across the globe and killed at least 213.

The Santa Clara Public Health Department said Friday that a man who lives outside San Francisco tested positive for the coronavirus. The patient contracted the virus in Wuhan, China, and has been isolated at home since, county officials said at a press conference.

"We've been preparing for this possibility for weeks," Santa Clara County Health Officer Dr. Sara Cody said. "Although we do understand this confirmed case may raise concerns, this one case in fact does not change the risk to the general public."

The news came the same day U.S. health officials quarantined 195 Americans in California who were evacuated from Wuhan earlier this week and the Trump administration declared a federal health emergency.
