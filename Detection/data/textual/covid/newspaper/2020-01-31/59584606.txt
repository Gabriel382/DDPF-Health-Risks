China taking ‘most comprehensive, strictest’ measures vs nCoV — envoy 
 MANILA, Philippines — Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian on Friday assured that the Chinese government is taking the “most comprehensive and strictest” measures against novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the country.

In a press briefing, Huang expressed confidence that their government would win against the epidemic.

“Compared with any epidemic in the past, I think we have taken the strictest measures some of which even go beyond the requirement of the World Health Organization [WHO],” Huang told reporters.

Huang also shared that Tedros Adhanom, director-general of the WHO, even “spoke very highly” of the efforts made by the Chinese government in the prevention and control of the virus.

He (Adhanom) has made it very clear that the measures taken by the Chinese government and Chinese people are not only good for the Chinese people but also good for the rest of the world,” Huang said.

Further, Huang said that they are continuing to work to curb the spread of the virus from Hubei province—where Wuhan City is located—to the other parts of China and from China to the rest of the world.

The Chinese envoy said that the recently confirmed case of the virus in the Philippines have also been “concerning to all of us.”

“We have been in very close communication with authorities of the Philippine government so we can share with them the information and provide assistance as deemed necessary,” Huang said.

In China, there are over 9,600 confirmed cases of the new virus with a death toll of at least 213, as per the WHO.

The WHO has also declared a global emergency over a new coronavirus outbreak.

The U.N. health agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. With a report from the Associated Press
