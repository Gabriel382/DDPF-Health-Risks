LGUs told: Set up nCoV task forces 
 The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) on Friday advised all local government units (LGUs) to form their coronavirus task forces in their localities to help contain the spread of the disease, after the first confirmed case hit the country.

Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said the local task forces would help implement Department of Health (DOH) protocols and guidelines and extend full cooperation to the national government to meet the world health emergency.

“Secretary Año has directed all LGUs to be on a state of preparedness and take all proactive steps to stop the spread of this disease,” said Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya, the DILG spokesperson.

According to Malaya, each task force under the direct leadership of local chief executives will ensure that local health workers have the necessary equipment and protective gadgets, such as masks, goggles, gowns and gloves.

“The task force should also cause the referral and transport of an nCoV suspect to a DOH-designated coronavirus referral center or hospital, in coordination with DOH and police authorities,” he said.

Malaya said local officials must train their health workers on nCoV prevention, containment and control, through the DOH.
