Coronavirus: US bars foreign nationals who have recently travelled to China 
 The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak and announced it will temporarily bar entry to the US for people traveling from China unless they are Americans or immediately related to US citizens. The restrictions on travel begin on Sunday afternoon.

“This is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasize the risk to the American public currently is low,” said US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Robert R Redfield on Friday. “It is our goal to keep it that way,” he said.

Americans returning from Hubei province will be subject to 14 days’ mandatory quarantine in an institutional setting upon their return, in order for health authorities to monitor them for the virus. Americans who have traveled to other parts of mainland China will be subject to home quarantine for 14 days.

“There is no travel ban,” said Joel Szabat, the assistant secretary for transportation, in response to a question from a reporter. He noted all three major air carriers had already halted flights to China in response to the epidemic.

“We have been seeing already a significant decrease in passengers going between the US and China,” said Szabat.

The new strain of coronavirus has spread rapidly in Hubei province, where nearly 10,000 people have been infected and more than 200 people died. Officials have confirmed six cases of coronavirus in the US, and another 121 people are being monitored for infection.

Another 132 cases of coronavirus have been detected in 23 more countries, including among 12 people who had not traveled to China.

“I want the Chinese people to know they have the deepest sympathies of the United States of America,” said deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegun.
