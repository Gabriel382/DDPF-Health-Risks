Coronavirus risk-on trade sweeps over the consumer sector 
 It's another down day for consumer companies with a presence in China as novel coronavirus developments continue to point to an extended period of reduced store traffic in the nation and outbound tourism to key markets

Nio (NIO ), Canada Goose (GOOS ), Luckin Coffee (LK ), Yum China (YUMC ), Ralph Lauren (RL ), PVH (PVH ), Tapestry (TPR ), Fossil (FOSL ) and Capri Holdings (CPRI ) are all lower on the day.

Some of the selling pressure is tied to concerns over Chinese spending even after the virus outbreak is contained.
