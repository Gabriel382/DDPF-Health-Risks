French Citizens Repatriated From Wuhan Arrive at Quarantine Location 
 Around 200 French citizens repatriated from the coronavirus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan arrived in the southern French town of Carry-le-Rouet on January 31. The Wuhan evacuees were due to spend two weeks in quarantine at a resort in the town. France’s health minister, Agnes Buzyn, was present on the day, and assured that the correct “sanitary conditions” were in place. This did little to quell local fears, however. Town mayor Jean Montagna spoke of an atmosphere of “panic” in an appearance on French television. Credit: What’s Up PACA via Storyful
