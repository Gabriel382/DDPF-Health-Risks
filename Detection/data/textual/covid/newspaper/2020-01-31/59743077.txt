Photo of Ighalo in Man Utd kit emerges ahead of deadline day loan transfer 
 Odion Ighalo will seemingly be joining his boyhood club when he finally signs on the dotted line for Manchester United.

The Nigerian forward, 30, is set to complete a season-long loan deal to join the Red Devils until the end of the current campaign, with the club racing against time to complete the switch before the closure of the transfer window on Friday evening.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has turned to the Shanghai Shenhua forward in a bid to help solve United's forward crisis, with Marcus Rashford facing at least another couple of months on the sidelines with a stress fracture of his back.

Anthony Martial and youngster Mason Greenwood are the only current forward options available Solskjaer, but Ighalo will help come in and ease that burden should he complete his switch.

And completing that transfer would be a dream come true for the forward, according to a BBC Sport journalist.

John Bennett tweeted that Ighalo - who is still currently in China due to the limits placed on travel after the Coronavirus outbreak - would be delighted to make the switch to the Red Devils, citing an old interview he did with him years ago.

Ighalo spoke to Bennett just after he'd scored 20 goals in 35 games to help Watford achieve promotion to the Premier League in 2015, and said that“it will be a dream come true to play at Old Trafford against the team I supported in my youth.”

Bennett also shared a photo of a young Ighalo wearing a blue Manchester United away shirt from the 2005/06 season as he posed with friends.

It seems as though the 30-year-old will soon be able to call himself a United player.
