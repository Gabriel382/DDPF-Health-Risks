China coronavirus: WHO declares international emergency as death toll exceeds 200 
 The World Health Organization has declared the current novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, as latest figures show that nearly 10 000 people have been infected and that over 200 have died.

WHO’s emergency committee reconvened on 30 January—a week after it first met—to reassess the situation. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said that the declaration was “not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries.”

He warned, “Our greatest concern is for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems that are ill prepared to deal with it.”
