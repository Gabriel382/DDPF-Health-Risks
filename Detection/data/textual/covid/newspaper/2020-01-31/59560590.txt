Coronavirus: Shortage of N95 masks in India as demand rises, drug association seeks ban on exports 
 As the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus as a global emergency, shortage of N95 mask -- effective in preventing the virus -- is now being reported in the local markets due to an increase in their export.

All India Food and Drug License Association (AFDLH), in its letter to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, on Friday, asked for a ban on exports of surgical face masks and N95 masks as they are not available in local markets.

"Manufacturers are getting huge orders for these masks which are being sold for 10-times more than their actual price. Due to this, Indian citizens will find it difficult to get these masks when needed. Hence the exports and price of these masks should be controlled, " the letter by AFDLH read.

The N95 respirator is designed to fit very closely to the face and, as a result, more efficiently filters airborne particles. The N95 face mask is available online but delivery can take up to two weeks, making it a less feasible option for customers.

"Given the high and lucrative demand in international markets, manufacturers are ignoring the need in local markets and busy in meeting the export demands. These trade activities have put Indians at the risk of not getting the masks to be safe from this [coronavirus] virus. Hence, we demand that the government should stop exports of these masks and control its price in the local market," Abhay Pande, National President, AFDLH Foundation, said.
