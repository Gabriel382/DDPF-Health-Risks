 Botswana registered its first suspected case of the coronavirus on Thursday, according to the country's Ministry of Health and Wellness.

A passenger travelling from China had arrived at the airport on an Ethiopian Airways flight.

"The suspected case is still being investigated," the ministry said.

It advised travellers to take precautions, such as practising good hygiene, getting medical help should they experience symptoms of the virus, and making sure they were screened at points of entry for early diagnoses.
