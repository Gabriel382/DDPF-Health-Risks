Pet owners seek face masks for dogs amid coronavirus outbreak 
 People in face masks are a familiar sight amid the coronavirus outbreak in China and as cases pop up around the globe. Now, some are making sure their pets are covered, as well.

While some stores have reported running out of masks for humans, companies that make face masks for dogs, such as Good Air Team, which owns K9 Mask, have also experienced a spike in sales within the past three days.

“We had a 300% sale increase in Amazon, which led us to run out of inventory,” said Kirby Holmes, owner of K9 Mask.

Most of the recent sales of the dog masks, which can cost up to $50, were shipped to customers in the U.S., according to Holmes.

Still, there’s no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization.

Masks are not usually recommended in non-health care settings, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This comes amid the outbreak of the new virus as the figures released by China on Thursday put the death toll at 170 for a total of 7,711 cases.

Most coronaviruses are spread through airborne droplets (sneezing or coughing), touching or touching an infected surface.

While the CDC does not discourage healthy people from wearing surgical masks as a precaution, the agency is only recommending their use for patients thought to have the virus and the medical professionals who interact with them.
