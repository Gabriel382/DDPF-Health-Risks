China ensures smooth traffic during Spring Festival travel rush - People's Daily Online 
 BEIJING, Jan. 30 -- China saw smooth and safe traffic on major expressways on Thursday, the seventh day of the Spring Festival holiday, said the country's traffic police.


	Traffic flow monitored on the day plummeted 87.7 percent year on year, according to the information released by the Traffic Management Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.


	The decrease in traffic flow was partly due to the country's extension of its seven-day Spring Festival holiday to ten days amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.


	Traffic management departments have vowed to give top priority to the epidemic prevention and control during the holiday travel rush.


	Efforts will be made to quarantine vehicles, passengers and goods and ensure smooth transportation of relief materials.


	Statistics showed that more than 190,000 traffic policemen have been mobilized nationwide.
