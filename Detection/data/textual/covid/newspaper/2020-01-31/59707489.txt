The symptoms include coughing, a fever and a general feeling of malaise. Some people may also have difficulty breathing.
There are now four cases of coronavirus confirmed in Canada, with B.C. confirming a case on Tuesday.
In China, the death toll has reached more than 200 people, while thousands of others are sick.
