US warns Americans against China travel 
 The US State Department has increased its travel advisory for China, telling Americans not to travel to the country.
The advice comes as the death toll from the fast spreading coronavirus rose to more than 200 and the World Health Organisation declared a global health emergency.
In a notice posted on its website, the State Department said: "Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China."
Six people have now been diagnosed with the coronavirus in the US.
The first five had all been to China, but the sixth, a man from Illinois, is the first US case of person-to-person transmission.
He is married to a Chicago woman who fell ill with the virus after returning last month from Wuhan.
