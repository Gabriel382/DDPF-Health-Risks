Wuhan virus: Japan to enforce special measures for coronavirus from Saturday 
 TOKYO (REUTERS) - Japan plans to bring forward the date that the coronavirus will become a "designated infectious disease" to Saturday (Feb 1) from Feb 7, public broadcaster NHK said.

Japanese health minister Katsunobu Kato said earlier on Friday that the government was considering moving up the date, without elaborating.

The government classified the virus as a designated infectious disease on Tuesday, a move that allows compulsory hospitalisation, stricter screening of people entering the country, and the use of public funds for treatment, among other measures.

In line with regulations, the designation was only set to take effect on Feb 7 after ordinances are issued.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, inaugurating a task force to deal with the virus, said the government would take all steps to prevent its spread, including tracking and checking people who had been in Wuhan.

Among Japan's cases was a tour bus driver who was infected after coming into contact with Chinese visitors.

Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya said the impact of the virus would depended on its spread but China's global presence was greater than when Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), which also originated in China, killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.
