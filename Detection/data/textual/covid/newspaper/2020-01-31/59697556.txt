Tucker Carlson, Trump Jr. mock CNN for story about lack of diversity on administration's coronavirus task force 
 A CNN story about the lack of diversity on's coronavirus task force drew swift criticism from conservatives this week after a scathing segment by Fox News host

In an online analysis for CNN , national political writer Brandon Tensley asked: "Who are these experts? They're largely the same sorts of white men (and a couple women on the sidelines) who've dominated the Trump administration from the very beginning."

The piece, published Thursday, included a photo tweeted by Trump of his task force meeting and contrasted it with former President Obama's Ebola task force.

"Speaking of viruses, wokeness is a virus," Carlson said Thursday night on his Fox News show. "It's infectious, it destroys your brain. You are watching it happen to people all around you, certainly on the left, some running for president, many working at CNN. You wind up writing stuff like that once you're infected. Totally insane."

Further blowback came fromÂ the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and former CNN contributor Steve Cortes.
