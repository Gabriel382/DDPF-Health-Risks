Novel coronavirus a public health emergency: WHO | India News - Times of India 
 NEW DELHI: Soon after India confirmed its first positive case of novel coronavirus in Kerala on Thursday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the nCoV outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.The UN agency maintained that its decision is based on not just what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.So far, around 9,692 confirmed cases of the infection and 213 deaths have been reported from the virus that was first reported from Wuhan in China.The virus has now been detected in 21 countries including India.Expecting further international exportation of nCoV cases, WHO asked all countries to prepare for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of the infection.Health ministry said it is in close touch with WHO and regularly reviewing preparedness.“We have put the health system on alert and also augmented screening of passengers at airports and ports. Besides, testing laboratories and hospitals are also geared up,” an official said.So far, India has screened more than 43,346 passengers arriving from China and one positive case has been detected.“Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research,” WHO said in its advice to all countries.It also said that though evidence shows restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies may be ineffective and may divert resources from other interventions, in certain specific circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful, such as in settings with limited response capacities and capabilities, or where there is high intensity of transmission among vulnerable populations.
