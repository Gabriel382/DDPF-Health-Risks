North Korea was set to suspend all flights and trains to and from China on Friday in response to the outbreak of a new, deadly coronavirus in the neighboring country, according to the British ambassador to North Korea.

“#NorthKorea introduces more restrictions on travel with all flights and trains between #DPRK and China suspended from 31 January in response to #Coronavirus,” Colin Crooks said on Twitter late on Thursday.
