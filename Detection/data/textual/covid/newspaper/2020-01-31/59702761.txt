Experts worry about the spread of coronavirus in India and Africa. But there's no need to panic... yet 
 It looks increasingly likely that the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is going to pose a threat for some time.

Two cases have been confirmed in the UK and the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the epidemic a “public health emergency of international concern”.

As of Friday, total confirmed cases stood at 9,776, more than 213 people had died, and the virus had spread to more than 20 countries, several of which were reporting limited onward human-to-human transmission.

These facts are unsettling but it’s important to keep a sense of perspective and there is certainly no cause for panic.

Against the backdrop of China’s 1.4 billion population, the numbers remain small. The case fatality rate, at about two per cent, is also mercifully low compared to those for Mers (30 per cent) and Sars (10 per cent) – respiratory infections from the same viral family.
