Planning a visit to China? Tips to avoid the coronavirus outbreak 
 Travellers planning a visit to mainland China are being advised to heed
government warnings to avoid all but essential trips to the country at the
centre of the coronavirus outbreak.

The US state department on Friday issued a “do not travel” warning for China and
said its citizens should consider leaving. Japan has also advised against
unnecessary travel to China.

The virulent nature of the flu-like illness that has killed 213 people and
infected more than 9,700 has heightened fears that the epidemic may spiral. But
for foreign visitors already in China, those considering a change of plan, and
those who have decided to travel nonetheless, here is some advice to bear in
mind.

HOW LONG WILL IT LAST? SHOULD I CHANGE PLANS?

Foreign governments have taken a cautious approach. The US has warned against
travelling while the UK has advised against trips to the province of Hubei at
the centre of the outbreak and said travellers should only visit the rest of
mainland China if it is “essential”. The British travel advice excludes trips to
Hong Kong and Macau.

Travel plans could also be complicated by the fact that some airlines, including
British Airways, have suspended flights to and from mainland China.

Several international events due to take place in China have been postponed,
including the World Athletics Indoor Championships in Nanjing in March and the
Def Con computer hacker conference in Beijing the following month. Wilbur Ross,
US commerce secretary, was among those to have reconsidered a planned visit to
China in February, according to people familiar with the matter.

But the annual “two sessions” meeting in March, in which about 3,000 Chinese
parliamentary delegates from around the country gather in Beijing, continues to
be open for media registration.

Scientists also said the disease outbreak is entering a crucial period where it
may either slow or accelerate. On the optimistic side, one of China’s leading
experts on respiratory diseases, Zhong Nanshan, said this week that he expected
the peak of the outbreak to be in seven to 10 days — that is, from Feb 5-8 —
after which there would be no “large-scale increases”.

However, the Sars outbreak that began in China in late 2002 continued to be
infectious eight months later. 

WHAT IF I HAVE A CONFERENCE OR WORK IN CHINA?

Chin/BloombergFor those who decide they must travel for business meetings,
Chinese state media has recommended wearing a face-mask, washing hands before
entering a conference room and sitting at least one metre away from colleagues.

An alternative would be to bring meetings online instead. Zoom, the
video-calling platform, has offered users in China free group online
videoconferencing with no time limit, a feature that is usually part of its paid
package.

Although many international remote-working platforms are blocked in China — most
notably Google’s suite of online editing tools, as well as Dropbox — there are a
few notable exceptions. GitHub, the code-management platform owned by Microsoft,
is accessible in China, as is Slack, the office messaging platform.

WHAT ABOUT TRAVELLING FOR LEISURE?

Many tour groups have been forced to cancel tripsMany Chinese tourist sites have
been closed indefinitely as a result of the outbreak, which curbs any
sightseeing plans. Some are advertising online virtual tours instead: Beijing’s
Forbidden Palace, for example, has 360-degree panoramas available on its
website. The added benefit is that they are unobscured by smog or other
tourists, and there are no queues.

Many international tour groups have been forced to cancel trips planned for
February, but there are still hopes among operators that trips planned for the
months that follow can still go ahead. China’s touring season starts in March
and gets busier through the spring, which is the best time of year for visiting
most parts of China.


“Our next customers are due to depart at the end of February and our next group
tour is scheduled for early March, so we will be reviewing the situation on a
daily basis,” Kuoni tour group said.


Although the central Hubei province and the city of Wuhan have their charms,
such as the lush East Lake, among the largest urban lakes in China, and a vast
history museum, it is not typically on tours of itineraries of China, so
visitors are unlikely to be directly affected by quarantine blocks.

HOW SHOULD I NAVIGATE PUBLIC TRANSPORT?

Other than in Wuhan, public transport and private taxis in cities are mostly
running as usual © Ivan Abreu/BloombergOfficials wearing protective suits will
check temperatures of each visitor using airports or train stations, often with
a non-contact thermometer to the forehead. The tests are strict: people have
reported being stopped for secondary screening not because they had a fever, but
because wearing their thick winter coats and hats indoors made them hotter than
usual.


If travellers are planning to travel around China using your own means, it
should be remembered that some highways and inter-province bus routes have been
suspended. Some of the more remote villages have also set up their own voluntary
quarantine zones.

It is, however, very unlikely that tourists would visit such places, and in any
case, China’s high-speed trains are a much more pleasant experience than the bus
network. Other than in Wuhan, public transport and private taxis in cities are
mostly running as usual.

You can check road closures and public transport options on a mapping service
that has Chinese government updates, such as Baidu Maps, or Apple Maps (which
uses China’s Gaode mapping provider). However, Google Maps will not be of much
help in China.

HOW DO I PROTECT MYSELF? DO FACE-MASKS WORK?

The general consensus is that rigorous handwashing is the best defence ©
Chinatopix/APThe consensus across medical experts is that the most important way
of stopping the spread of germs is by washing hands thoroughly, and avoiding
touching the eyes or mouth. Face-masks are common in China, even more so since
the new outbreak began, and wearing one has been one of the most commonly
reiterated directives of the coronavirus crisis.

Yet there is a lot of debate over the efficacy of wearing face-masks. Experts
say that the most commonly-worn surgical masks — often blue, and loosely fitted
around the face — easily let in air. Masks are also commonly used ineffectively,
which can lead to misplaced confidence.


“The evidence is limited, and people have different opinions,” said Nathalie
MacDermott, a lecturer at King’s College London, adding that surgical masks were
useful for stopping a sick person contaminating others, but there was less
certainty over how they can stop a healthy person getting ill.

“The very basic, flimsy surgical mask offers limited protection because the fit
may be inadequate and they can become moist quite quickly through the act of
breathing in and out,” added Ms MacDermott, saying “any protection is lost” if
the mask becomes moist inside.


The UK’s Health and Safety Laboratory, a research centre,recommended those in
close contact with patients during the 2009 flu pandemic wear surgical masks, to
protect against being coughed or sneezed on. But there is little evidence as to
whether these masks are helpful for adding protection in everyday, non-close
contact settings, such as walking down the street.


Properly fitted respirator masks — which create more of a seal around the face —
are much better at reducing the amount of virus that gets behind the mask, and
healthcare workers undergo specialised fittings for these. The minimum standard
for these are “N95” rated masks, so-named because they block 95 per cent of
small (0.3 micron) particles from entering — when worn correctly. They often
have a metal strip on the top of the nose, which can be adjusted for fit.


Wearing a mask for too long, or using the same one over and over, can bring its
own problems. China’s Centre for Disease Control recommends replacing masks
every two to four hours. In the end, it may be wise to wear a face mask in China
simply to avoid upsetting those around you.

© Owen Humphreys/PACheck that your airline is still flying, as a string of
European, US and some Asian airlines have cancelled flights or reduced
frequency. British Airways this week became the first big carrier to suspend
flights to and from mainland China, a move followed by Germany’s Lufthansa. BA
has blocked out sales until March.

Delta and American Airlines are cutting flights between the US and China while
Air France suspended all services to and from Shanghai and Beijing having
already suspended flights to Wuhan. Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific has halved
the number of flights to and from mainland China.

When packing for a trip, it is always advisable to bring hand disinfectant and
tissue paper while travelling in China, as often public bathrooms will not come
stocked with toilet paper and soap.


If you happen to have access to medical-grade masks, scrubs, gloves, or other
medical protective gear — do consider bringing it to China to donate. Several
hospitals in Wuhan are asking for donations of medical protective items, which
you can post from inside or outside China.


You should always contact your insurer to check your specific coverage plan and
whether your travel to China may void any part of it.

More broadly, some insurance companies, such as the Hong Kong branches of Axa,
Prudential, and Manulife have announced additional medical coverage for those
hospitalised as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, such as increased daily
payment rates.
