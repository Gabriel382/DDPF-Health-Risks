Coronavirus death toll soars to 249 after medics confirm spate of new fatalities 
 The coronavirus death toll has surged to 249 after medics confirmed 45 news deaths today.

The local health commission in China also said there was 1,347 new cases of the infection.

That brings the total number of those affected to a devastating 7,153.

China is currently trying to contain the outbreak which started in Wuhan.

But there have been cases confirmed around the world including the UK.

Earlier today it was also declared a global health emergency by WHO.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: "The main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries."

Two cases in the UK were also confirmed, according to the chief medical officer for England.

The Chinese nationals were staying at a hotel in York before they were taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.

Hotel bosses at Staycity have kept the facility open, but insist it has been thoroughly disinfected.

A flight carrying 83 Brits from Wuhan landed in the UK, and are being taken to a hospital in Wirral.

They will be quarantined for 14 days.
