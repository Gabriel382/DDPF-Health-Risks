Coronavirus evacuations: CDC orders 14-day federal quarantine for Americans flown to California 
 The increase, in part, prompted the CDC to mandate that the U.S. citizens who were flown in from Wuhan this week stay on March Air Reserve Base in California for a total of 14 days since they left China. Previously, the passengers had been asked to stay on base for 72 hours, pending test results for the new coronavirus.

"We would rather be remembered for overreacting than underreacting," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a call with journalists. "While we recognize this is an unprecedented action, we are facing an unprecedented health threat."

Six other cases have been diagnosed in the United States, including two in Chicago â€” a married couple, confirming the first person-to-person spread of the virus here.

Other cases include one patient each in Arizona and Washington, and two in California.

The epicenter of the outbreak remains in China, where more than 200 people have died. On Thursday, the World Health Organization declared the situation a global public health emergency.
