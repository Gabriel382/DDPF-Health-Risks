 The first cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed in the UK as two English patients from the same family have tested positive for the killer virus.



The patients have now become the first English people to be diagnosed with the virus on British soil since the outbreak in Wuhan, China.

The Department of Health said it would not reveal any details about the patients

Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England said in a statement this morning: 'We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus.

'The patients are receiving specialist NHS care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus.

'The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread.

'We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately. We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities.'

In another news, about 83 Brits and 27 foreign nationals are currently being repatriated from the disease's epicentre city Wuhan.

So far, 213 people have died in China after contracting the coronavirus with 9,692 others infected around the world.
