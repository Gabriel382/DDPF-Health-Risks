West Ham want three deadline day transfers as coronavirus blocks Marko Arnautovic return 
 Moyes drew positives from their most recent loss, despite seeing goals from Mohamed Salah and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain consign them to another pointless evening.
"I thought we did a lot of good things and were tactically well-organised, but ultimately you still need to score goals," Moyes said.
"We made the chances to score those goals - obviously you can talk about the opportunities Liverpool had because they get them in every game, but I thought we limited them a bit tonight and made one or two ourselves.
"We’re a bit disappointed with the goals, we’re disappointed with the penalty kick, we’re disappointed that they scored from a counter-attack from our corner, but not disappointed overall with the players’ performances. I thought they all did well."
