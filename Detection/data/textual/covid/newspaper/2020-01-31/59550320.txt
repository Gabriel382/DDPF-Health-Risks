Hospital waiting room evacuated after staff ID two possible coronavirus cases 
 Dozens of patients had to abandon the waiting room at an English hospital after two suspected coronavirus cases were flagged up by staff.

Both patients spent two hours waiting alongside others at the New QEII Hospital in Hertfordshire last night, according to a witness.

Video of the incident circulating online showed a member of NHS staff explaining to patients why they’d been moved.

The 39-year-old witness, who asked not to be named, said: ‘We were in the waiting room and the nurse said we suspect its coronavirus, can we vacate the waiting room?

‘We got moved down a corridor, maybe 40 metres away, into a separate area while they did a disinfectant clean.

‘They’d been in there for two hours, one fella was saying “I sat next to them for the last two hours”.’

The witness said everybody’s details were taken and they were told they’d be contacted if the tests came back positive.

He said: ‘We were told “We’ve got all your details, we’re going to do tests, and if it is that, we’ll come back and let you know”.’

The East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, which runs the hospital in Welwyn Garden City, said it was aware of the incident but referred all enquiries to the Department of Health & Social Care (DHSC).

The DHSC said it would not comment on individual cases.

However, the department said that 161 tests had been carried out on UK patients, none of which had come back positive for the coronavirus.

It also stated that 1,466 passengers and 95 staff had arrived in the UK on direct flights from Wuhan between January 10 and 24, of which 922 had already left the country or passed the incubation period.

The update said: ‘There are currently no confirmed cases in the UK or of UK citizens abroad, and the risk to the public is low.

‘The government is monitoring the situation closely and will continue to work with the World Health Organisation and international community.’
