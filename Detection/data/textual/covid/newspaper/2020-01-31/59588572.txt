Coronavirus symptoms and NHS advice as UK cases confirmed 
 The first cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, with two members of the same family infected.

The disease, which originated in Wuhan, China, has killed more than 210 people and infected at least 8,000.

From the same family of viruses as SARS, coronavirus has spread to over 20 countries, including the USA, Canada, France, South Korea, Japan and Germany.

Now that it is confirmed to have reached the UK, here's everything you need to know about symptoms, and what to do if you're concerned that you may have been infected.

Early symptoms of the coronavirus include a fever, diarrhea, a dry cough, shortness of breath and general body aches.

In severe cases, it can cause a high fever, kidney failure and pneumonia.

The initial symptoms are similar to other respiratory illnesses - such as the flu or the common cold.

Coronaviruses are typically spread through the air, with infected people coughing or sneezing, or by close personal contact, such as shaking hands.

It's also possible to be infected by touching an object or surface with the virus on it, and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands.

To protect yourself, you should wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your face.

If you have recently travelled to a high-risk area - or if you've been in contact with somebody who has - and you develop symptoms, you can contact NHS 111 for advice.

You should not go to the doctor or to hospital, as you may risk spreading the virus to others.

The NHS is asking anybody who has recently travelled to Wuhan to self-quarantine themselves for 14 days.
