Officially called Cultures of China, Festival of Spring, viewers could see the Oceania Troupe sing, perform folk music and dance modern ballet.

The troupe first came to Wellington in 2012, returning in 2014 and 2017.

Hosted by the Wellington Chinese Garden Society Incorporated, its chairman Steven Young said the Oceania troupe was not allowed to travel.

The decision was out of the society's hands, he said.

"There's nothing we can do but we'll have another chance next year."

However, Wellingtonians could still celebrate Chinese New Year on the weekend at TSB Arena.

In Auckland, the Northcote Chinese and Korean New Year Festival has been cancelled as its organisers said they needed to be cautious.

Northcote Town Centre Manager Gary Holmes said the event was being cancelled reluctantly but that it was the right thing to do in this particular situation.

"Northcote has a very high population of travellers to and from China, especially during Chinese New Year and the situation is still unknown.

"Our local Chinese community, including those performing and attending, have told us they would prefer that the event did not proceed this year, which we understand and respect."
