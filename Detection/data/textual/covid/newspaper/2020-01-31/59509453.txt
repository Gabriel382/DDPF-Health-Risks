Wuhan virus: US tells Americans not to travel to China 
 WASHINGTON (REUTERS, BLOOMBERG) - The US State Department increased its travel advisory for China on Thursday (Jan 30), as the death toll from a fast spreading virus rose to over 200 and the World Health Organisation (WTO) declared a global health emergency.

In a notice posted on its website, the State Department said: "Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China."

The disease now has more global cases than were officially reported during the Sars epidemic and the spread of the sometimes deadly pathogen shows no signs of abating.

Confirmed cases in China jumped to 9,692, the National Health Commission reported Friday, up from about 7,700 a day earlier.

In the US, health officials reported the first case of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus, in a woman who travelled to China and then infected her husband.

India documented its first case on Thursday, while Russia closed its land border with China to travellers.
