Coronavirus outbreak: WHO officials praise Chinese response amid declaring public health emergency 
 The World Health Organization has declared an outbreak of a new coronavirus from Wuhan, China, to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday.



Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who spoke to the press on Jan. 30, praised the Chinese government's "extraordinary" measures to contain the novel coronavirus outbreak, and even said that in many ways, China has actually set a new standard for outbreak response.



In addition, Tedros shared seven recommendations that the WHO has set forth regarding the virus outbreak. These recommendations included having no need for implementing measures that interfere with international trade and travel, supporting countries with weaker health system, accelerate development of vaccines and more. 



Only five emergencies have been declared in the past decade: the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, an Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, a polio outbreak in 2014, the Zika virus in 2016 and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
