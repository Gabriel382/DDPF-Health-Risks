A man, who did not want to be named, told the Mercury he had been getting updates from a friend who is on the flight.
The man was sent a message at 2.35pm from his friend saying she was on the ground and waiting to disembark.
A message at 2.42pm read: “A Chinese guy said he wasn’t feeling well, so we are waiting for medical advice. He told the steward that he has only been to Singapore, not China. Hopefully won’t be too long.”
The woman sent the man another message at 2.52pm: “Waiting for Ambulance Tasmania to turn up for their assessment of the person.”
The man, who is waiting to pick up his friend, said he saw two ambulances pass him in the direction of the airport.
At 3.51pm, the woman again wrote to the man: “I can see the guy and he looks OK, not impressed with contingency plan of airline or the airport.”
As at 4pm, passengers had still not disembarked.
In a statement, a Jetstar spokesman said: “A passenger reported feeling unwell towards the end of one of our Melbourne-Hobart flights this afternoon.
“As a precaution and following standard procedure, the captain asked ambulance to meet the aircraft on arrival and attend to the passenger.”
More to come.
