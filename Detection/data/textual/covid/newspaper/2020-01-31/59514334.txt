18 S. Koreans from Wuhan to be Quarantined After Showing Pneumonia-Like Symptoms 
 Eighteen out of 368 South Koreans who arrived from China's Wuhan on a chartered plane on Friday showed symptoms that could be related to the new coronavirus.


The central disaster relief headquarters led by the Health Ministry said 12 of the suspected patients showed symptoms before boarding the flight, while the other six displayed symptoms after landing at Gimpo International Airport.


Fourteen of them will receive medical treatment in quarantine at the National Medical Center and four at Chung-Ang University Hospital.


Others with no symptoms will be taken to two quarantine facilities in the central Chungcheong region. Two hundred will go to the Police Human Resources Development Institute in Asan and 150 to the Jincheon office of the National Human Resources Development Institute.


The South Korean government is in talks with China to evacuate the remaining South Koreans in the virus-stricken city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas.
