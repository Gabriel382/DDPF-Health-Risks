Adamson advises Chinese students to observe self-quarantine 
 MANILA, Philippines — Chinese students of Adamson University were advised Friday to observe self-quarantine until February 14–a period of two weeks—at a time of the threat posed by novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.

A memorandum released by the university’s president said that the advisory covers both graduate and undergraduate students.

“In response to the worldwide precautionary measures against the nCoV, Adamson University would like to ensure a healthy and virus-free environment,” the memorandum states.

“Thus, we have made a decision that all Chinese students, both graduate and undergraduate, observe self-quarantine starting today until February 14, 2020,” it added.

Further, the memorandum states that “all Chinese nationals are also advised to postpone all transactions inside the university until February 14, 2020.”

Professor and the affected students are urged to maximize the use of the university’s e-learning system.

Local and other international students, meanwhile, will continue with their classes.

The health department confirmed on Thursday afternoon that a 38-year-old Chinese tourist has been found infected with the new coronavirus that started in the city of Wuhan, China.

The Chinese woman came from Wuhan and arrived in the Philippines on January 21 before seeking medical attention four days later.
