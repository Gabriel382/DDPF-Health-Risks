 Pakistan stops China flight operations: report


ISLAMABAD: Hours after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency due to coronavirus outbreak, Pakistan on Friday halted flights to and from China with immediate effect, a civil aviation official told Reuters news agency.
“We are suspending flights to China until Feb 2,” additional secretary of aviation Abdul Sattar Khokhar told Reuters by phone, adding the situation would be reviewed after that date.
He declined to comment on the reason for the closure.
Some airlines including British Airways, have suspended flights to China due to warnings of the coronavirus outbreak.
