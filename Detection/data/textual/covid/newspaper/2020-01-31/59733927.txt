Donald Trump administration declares coronavirus to be public health emergency 
 WASHINGTON – The Donald Trump administration declared the coronavirus to be a public health emergency in the United States on Friday, though he and aides downplayed the threat of the virus to Americans.

"The risk of infection for Americans remains low," said Alex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services and chairman of the coronvirus tax force set up by Trump. "We are working to keep the risk low."

U.S. citizens from parts of China will undergo entry health screenings and will be monitored during a 14-day self-quarantine, officials said. Azar also announced a suspension of entry into the United States of foreign nationals who pose a risk for the transmission of the virus.

Three U.S. airlines – Delta, American and United – have announced they will temporarily cancel all of their flights to mainland China out of concern for the coronavirus outbreak.

As of Friday, the outbreak had infected nearly 10,000 people, most of them in China, and killed more than 200 people, all in China.

The White House made its announcement a day after the U.S. State Department recommended that Americans not travel to China. That change followed the World Health Organization's declaration of a global health emergency over coronavirus.
