Coronavirus Prompts US to Initiate 14-Day Quarantine to Americans Who Traveled to Hubei Province 
 During the televised briefing, Trump administration officials noted that the coronavirus is a public health emergency in the US, but stressed that the virus was at a low risk for Americans.

US citizens traveling from Hubei will be quarantined at Department of Homeland (DHS) designated sites whereas those traveling from other parts of China will be screened at ports of entry and asked to quarantine themselves at home for the 14-day duration.

Three US airlines on Friday, namely Delta, United and American, all volunteered to suspend service to mainland China. According to US Acting Department of Transportation Undersecretary Joel Szabat, no additional transportation suspensions will be enforced yet.

As of Friday, the virus had infected around 10,000 people around the world. The virus has also caused at least 213 deaths. No deaths have yet been reported outside of China.

Following the US government's declaration that the coronavirus is a public health emergency, stock markets immediately plunged by more than 600 points.

The CDC also confirmed Thursday the first case of person-to-person transmission of the virus within the US.

The spread of the Wuhan coronavirus has been compared to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, which was first reported in Asia back in 2003 and was caused by a similar coronavirus. It spread to 37 countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing 774 in 2003 over a six-month-period before being contained. The Wuhan coronavirus has already infected some 10,000 people in about a month’s time.
