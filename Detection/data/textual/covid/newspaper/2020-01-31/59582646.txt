Two people in Britain test positive for coronavirus 
 Two members of the same family in the UK have tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus, England’s chief medical officer has confirmed.

Cases in the UK had long been expected. The virus has already spread to 18 other countries outside China.

The Department of Health declined to say where in England the patients were from but they were not in the Wirral area where a special facility has been set up to quarantine Britons evacuated from Wuhan in China.

“We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. The patients are receiving specialist NHS care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus,” said the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty.

“The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread.

“We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately. We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities.”
