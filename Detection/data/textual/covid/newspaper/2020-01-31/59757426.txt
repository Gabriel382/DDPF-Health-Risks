Coronavirus Outbreak Forces Taipei Game Show Delay 
 The Taipei Game Show in Taiwan has been postponed due to the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus. The event organizers have not announced when the replacement dates for the event.

According to a report by VG247, the organizers for the Taipei Game Show sent over a list of precautions to attendees for the show including temperature checks and mandatory mask requirements.

Following the warnings, the organizers decided to cancel the event altogether. The show was originally scheduled to run from February 6 to February 9 at the Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center in Taiwan.

“We are deeply sorry to announce the difference decision from our committee,” said the organizers in a statement. “However, due to the serious outbreak of Wuhan coronavirus, we have decided to postpone the event to this summer.”

The coronavirus has infected over 9,000 people and killed 213. The World Health Organization has declared the virus a global health emergency.

The Taipei Game Show has been held since 2003, and there were some exciting developments including how Sony would host a PlayStation booth at the event and how Bandai Namco was set to drop some potential Elden Ring information.

There’s no word yet on how the delay would affect any potential announcements.
