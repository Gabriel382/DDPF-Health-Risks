Not to freak you out during this time of the coronavirus global health emergency but those airplane blankets you want to hide your head in just may be carrying germs of the passengers who have used them before you.

The sad fact is that airplane blankets are rarely washed between flights, making them something to avoid rather than request.

A good blanket, though, can make the difference between a comfortable flight and one that leaves you cold and miserable.

Here are some great blankets that will be so appreciated by frequent travelers. They’re the fabric equivalent of a loving hug.
