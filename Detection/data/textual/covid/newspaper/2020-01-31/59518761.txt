Robredo tells Duterte: Ban all travelers from China now 
 MANILA - Vice President Leni Robredo on Friday urged President Rodrigo Duterte to ban all travelers coming from China after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a global emergency.

"Ang kasalukuyang banta ng coronavirus sa bawat Pilipino ay nangangailangan ng agarang aksyon mula sa ating pamahalaan," she said in a statement.

The fast-spreading virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed at least 213 people and infected nearly 10,000 others in China as of Friday.

The United Nations health agency said the declaration of a global emergency aims to arrest cross-border transmission of the virus, which has spread to at least 18 countries.

In her statement, Robredo also urged the Duterte administration to give support to Filipinos that could be affected by the virus, which health authorities said could be transmitted between humans through close contact.

"Buhay ng tao ang nakasalalay kaya agarang aksyon, tamang impormasyon at mabilisang desisyon ang kailangan," she said.

Her statement comes a day after the Philippine government confirmed the country's first case of the virus -- a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China who arrived in the Philippines January 21.

The woman arrived in Manila via Hong Kong on Jan. 21. She is now in an undisclosed government hospital. - With a report from Adrian Ayalin, ABS-CBN News
