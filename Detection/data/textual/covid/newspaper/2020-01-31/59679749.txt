Delta Will Suspend Flights to China 
 Delta Air Lines said on Friday morning that it would suspend flights to and from China from Feb. 6 to April 30 as concerns about coronavirus spread across the globe.
In a statement posted on its site and emailed to The Times, the airline said the last flight to China leaving from the United States will depart on Monday, Feb. 3 and the last flight to the United States from China will leave China Wednesday, Feb. 5.
The airline’s announcement came a day after the United States State Department raised its travel advisory to Level 4: “Do not travel” and after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency because of the spreading virus.
While Delta is the first American airline to completely suspend service to China because of the virus, other airlines, including American and United cut their service to the country this week. The airlines have been offering fee waivers for people traveling to China.


In its statement, Delta said customers whose flights are affected can get information from the My Trips section of the Delta site to understand how to request a refund and rebook their travel after April 30.
