Delta to suspend all flights between US and China over coronavirus 
 Delta Air Lines announced Friday that it plans to suspend all flights between the United States and China due to the spread of the coronavirus.

The suspension of flights will begin on Feb. 6 and last through April 30. The airline said it is not suspending flights right away to allow people a chance to leave China before the suspension begins.

“Delta has decided to temporarily suspend all U.S. to China flying beginning Feb. 6 through April 30 due to ongoing concerns related to the coronavirus,” the airline said. “Between now and Feb. 5, Delta will continue to operate flights to ensure customers looking to exit China have options to do so.”

Delta’s move comes as pressure grows on its rival, American Airlines, to suspend flights. The pilots union for American on Thursday sued the airline because of the “serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus.”

“We are in close contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and global public health officials to make sure we are taking all necessary precautions for our customers and team members,” American Airlines said Thursday.

The flight announcements come as the virus continues to spread. The World Health Organization on Thursday called it a public health emergency of international concern.

The State Department on Thursday night also warned Americans not to travel to China because of the virus.
