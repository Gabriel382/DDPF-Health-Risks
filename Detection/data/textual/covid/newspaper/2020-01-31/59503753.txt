 Thailand arrests two for ‘fake news’ posts on coronavirus

BANGKOK: Thai authorities arrested two people for posting "fake news" about the coronavirus as a senior official on Thursday warned internet users to think twice before sharing incorrect information about the pathogen.
The Southeast Asian country has detected 14 cases, the second-highest number outside China where 170 have been killed since the outbreak emerged in the city of Wuhan. Thailand´s digital economy minister Buddhipongse Punnakanta told AFP that a man and woman were charged with violating the computer crimes act -- which can carry up to five years in prison -- for separate social media posts about the SARS-like virus. One was a misleading video clip while another promoted false information about an alleged case in a beachside city.
"They already admitted that they created fake news," Buddhipongse said, adding that more suspects are being investigated and others should take note. "You better think a lot more and look for sources of where news comes from."
