Wuhan officials 'should have acted sooner' 
 The coronavirus has affected more than 9800 people worldwide since the outbreak began in Wuhan

The Communist Party chief in the city at the centre of China's coronavirus outbreak says measures should have been taken earlier to contain it.

Ma Guoqiang said in a televised interview the impact of the virus on the rest of China and the world "would have been less" if the containment measures had been implemented sooner.

The outbreak that began in Wuhan, capital of China's central province of Hubei, has so far killed more than 200 people, all in China.

The virus has affected more than 9800 people worldwide, surpassing the total from the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic.

Earlier on Friday Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang said the task of containing and preventing the spread of the coronavirus outbreak in the city remains "severe and complex".

At the same televised news conference, Vice Mayor Xu Honglan said supplies of masks and other medical resources were still inadequate.

The US and other countries tightened travel curbs on Friday and businesses said they were facing supply problems because of the coronavirus, a day after the World Health Organisation declared a global health emergency.
