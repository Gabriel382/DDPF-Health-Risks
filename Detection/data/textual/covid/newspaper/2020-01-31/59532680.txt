Duque: PhilHealth to offer coverage for suspected new coronavirus cases 
 MANILA - Filipinos who may seek medical attention with symptoms of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will get health coverage from the state health insurance agency, the country's top health official said on Friday.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) convened on Thursday and decided to offer the new coronavirus package.

"The package is about a thousand per day for the hospital that takes care of a patient, even not confirmed, basta (as long as) suspected with novel coronavirus," said Duque on ANC's Headstart.

He said if the patient develops pneumonia, there is another PhilHealth package that may apply.

"If pneumonia sets in then there's pneumonia package of mild, P16,000; severe P32,000," he said.

The Philippines on Thursday confirmed its first case of the 2019-nCoV, a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. She is now in an undisclosed government hospital in Metro Manila and currently asymptomatic.

Some 31 others are under investigation for the acute respiratory disease.

At least 200 people have died, while close to 10,000 people have been infected in several parts of China and countries in Europe, Asia and North America.

Its symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties, according to the World Health Organization.
