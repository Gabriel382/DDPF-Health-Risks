State Department urges against travel to China 
 The State Department on Thursday night urged Americans not to travel to China amid the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak and urged U.S. citizens already in the country to consider leaving.

The Level 4 — Do Not Travel advisory stated U.S. officials had limited ability to provide emergency services at the epicenter of the outbreak, in Hubei province. The advisory came hours after the World Health Organization declared a global public health emergency because of the spread of the virus and the CDC confirmed a sixth case in the United States — the first involving person-to-person transmission.

The outbreak has killed more than 200 people in China and sickened more than 8,000 worldwide. As of Wednesday, 92 possible cases of the respiratory disease were under investigation in the United States.
