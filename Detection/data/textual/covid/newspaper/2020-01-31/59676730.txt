Man with coronavirus discharged from Toronto hospital 
 Toronto’s Sunnybrook Hospital says a man who was diagnosed with the new coronavirus was discharged on Friday.
The man, who is in his 50s, was the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus in Canada. He and his wife, who was later confirmed to have the virus, recently travelled to Wuhan, China, which is the epicentre of the outbreak.
On Thursday, Ontario health officials said the man was recovering in hospital while his wife was doing well in isolation at home.
Officials also said 27 others were being monitored for the virus in Ontario.
Ontario’s associate chief medical officer of health Dr. Barbara Yaffe said that so far, 67 people have been tested for the virus in Ontario. According to Yaffe, 38 tests came back negative and the 27 people who remain under observation are either at home in isolation or in hospital.
