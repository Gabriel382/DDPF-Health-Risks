CebuPac checking if Chinese woman with Wuhan virus was passenger – spox 
 MANILA, Philippines — Cebu Pacific is checking if the Chinese woman who tested positive for the novel coronavirus was a passenger on one of its flights, the airline’s spokesperson said Friday.

“We have yet to verify,” Cebu Pacific spokesperson Charo Logarta Lagamon said in an interview with dzMM when asked if the 38-year-old Chinese national was a passenger on one of their flights.

Lagamon said they only received the information that the Chinese woman took a Cebu Pacific flight through various media interviews given by the Department of Health (DOH).

DOH spokesperson Undersecretary Eric Domingo was quoted as saying in an ABS-CBN news report that the Chinese national took Cebu Pacific, Cebgo and Philippine Airline flights throughout her travel from Wuhan to Hong Kong, then to Cebu to Dumaguete and then to Manila.

“Yung information na nakuha po namin ay the same as all of you na kung ano lang po yung sinabi nila sa media pero wala po pong any coordination pa po with us,” Lagamon went on.

She said Cebu Pacific is waiting for the DOH to coordinate with the airline for the contact tracing.

“We did our initial checking na po. Kumabaga that’s checking on our part but we have to wait for DOH to advises  or directs us on what is the next step,” Lagamon said.

“Dahil po ang protcol for quarantine and contact tracing po ay saklaw or jurisditction po ng Department of Health,” she added.

The airline earlier announced that it would reduce direct flights between the Philippines, China, Hong Kong, and Macau after the DOH announced the first case of novel coronavirus in the Philippines.
