Gov't advises Japanese in China to consider coming home due to new coronavirus' spread 
 TOKYO -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Jan. 31 advised Japanese nationals staying in China to consider temporarily returning home or taking other safety precautions amid the outbreak of a new coronavirus.

The advisory was aimed at Japanese citizens across China, not just those in Hubei province, the outbreak's epicenter.

"We recommend they (Japanese nationals) do their best to gather information and take other steps to prepare for the possibility that travel restrictions will be expanded further, and consider how to ensure their safety including temporarily returning to Japan," says the advisory posted on the ministry's website.

The Japanese government is also set to raise its travel alert for infectious diseases for all of China (excluding Hubei province) from 1 (exercise caution) to 2 (avoid non-essential travel). The move comes after the World Health Organization declared on Jan. 30 that the coronavirus is a "public health emergency of international concern."

Tokyo will maintain its travel alert for Hubei province and its capital Wuhan at level 3 (avoid all travel).
