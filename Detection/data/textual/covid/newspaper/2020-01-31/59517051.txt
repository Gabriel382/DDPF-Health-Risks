China NBS Manufacturing PMI 
 The Official NBS Manufacturing PMI in China edged down to 50.0 in January 2020 from 50.2 in the previous month and in line with market estimates. This was the weakest reading since a contraction in October, amid Beijingâ€™s efforts to contain an ongoing Wuhan coronavirus outbreak that has claimed over 200 lives in the country so far, with WHO declaring a global health emergency. Output rose the least in three months (51.3 vs 53.2 in December) while export orders shrank again (48.7 vs 50.3) and employment continued to fall (47.5 vs 47.3). Meantime, new orders expanded for the third month in a row and at the fastest rate since April 2019. Also, buying levels advanced steeper (51.6 vs 51.3), the third consecutive month of increase. On the price front, input cost inflation accelerated noticeably (53.8 vs 51.8), while selling prices dropped for the ninth straight month and at a stronger rate. Finally, sentiment strengthened sharply (57.9 vs 54.4).

Business Confidence in China is expected to be 49.70 points by the end of this quarter, according to Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations. Looking forward, we estimate Business Confidence in China to stand at 50.50 in 12 months time. In the long-term, the China NBS Manufacturing PMI is projected to trend around 51.00 points in 2020, according to our econometric models.
