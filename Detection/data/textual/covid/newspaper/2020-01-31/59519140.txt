Chinese get creative with masks as supplies dry up 
 As surgical mask supplies dry up across China and many other countries, people are getting creative in a bid to protect themselves against the exploding coronavirus epidemic.
There are now more than 8200 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV worldwide and 171 deaths, all of them in China.
At least seven people have contracted the disease in Australia but that figure is likely to soar over coming days as authorities investigate dozens of suspected cases.
Photographs of people using scooped-out grapefruits and oranges, motorcycle helmets and even sanitary pads are being shared across social media.
The Associated Press even put out a video showing how to fashion two face masks out of a bra.
Hospitals are not immune to the shortage, with staff at one putting out a video showing how to make a face covering from a plastic document sleeve.
The desperate measures come as footage emerged of second-hand masks being redistributed and people boiling their masks and hanging them up to dry.
Chinese authorities have warned people to discard their masks after four hours but there are simply not enough of them to go around, forcing people to improvise.
While researchers have yet to establish all the different ways the virus can be spread from person to person, it is believed to transmit via infected saliva and mucus.
Many people are going for whole head coverings after a Chinese doctor who contracted the virus while treating patients in Wuhan said he believed he was infected through his eyes.
Here are some of the best DIY efforts.
