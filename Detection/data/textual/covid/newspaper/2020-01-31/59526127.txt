Govt 'taking evidence-based approach' to coronavirus 
 Liberal Senator James Paterson says “the government is taking an evidence-based approach” to the coronavirus and not “unnecessarily panicking.” “We have to get the balance right between taking this seriously, which we are, and not unnecessarily panicking and sending fear to people to people that is not needed,” he told Sky News. One of the great things about living in a democracy and an open system is that you can see all that and it can be criticised from every point of view and there is no doubt about our sincerity in the way we’re going about it”. A second person in Queensland was diagnosed with the virus overnight, bringing Australia's total confirmed cases to nine. Four cases have also been recorded in NSW and three in Victoria.
