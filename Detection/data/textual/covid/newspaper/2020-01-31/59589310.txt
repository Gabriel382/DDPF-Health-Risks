 Carrasco poised for Atletico return
Belgian winger Yannick Carrasco is on his way back to Atletico Madrid from Chinese club Dalian Yifang, according to reports. 
The Chinese Super League has been suspended amid the coronavirus outbreak, meaning the 26-year-old is concerned about a lack of playing time ahead of Euro 2020 as he aims to make Roberto Martinez’s Belgium squad.
Carrasco was linked with Manchester United, but is said to favour a return to the club he played at from 2015-2018 before moving to China.
Atleti boss Diego Simeone is seeking more attacking options, and the move could be a loan one initially.
