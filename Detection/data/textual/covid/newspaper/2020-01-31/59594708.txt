Bakambu: Barcelona make transfer U-turn in signing Beijing Guoan forward - Report | Goal.com 
 Barcelona were reportedly set to sign Cedric Bakambu on loan with a purchase option but the move for the Beijing Guoan forward broke down at the last minute.

The former Villarreal forward is in Seoul with the rest of his Beijing Guoan teammates training before their AFC Champions League opening game against FC Seoul on February 11.

According to L'Equipe, Barcelona met with Bakambu's representatives, and they had agreed a deal with the Chinese outfit to release the 28-year-old with the Super League season indefinitely suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak in the country.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo striker was set for a return to Spain, and he flew to Hong Kong where he was scheduled to fly to Barcelona only for him to receive a call from the Catalan club's director of football, Eric Abidal, who pulled the plug on the deal.

Bakambu took to social media to verify the botched move and also expressed his disappointment.

"Yo Transfermarkt, change my transfer history with 'almost Barcelona' please," Bakambu tweeted.

“No matter what happens, we trust the process. Thank God for everything. See you another time, Antoine Griezmann."

Bakambu left Villarreal for China in January 2018, and he has notched 29 goals across two seasons in the Chinese top-flight.

He helped Beijing Guoan finish as runners-up in the Super League last term after winning the Chinese FA Cup in his debut campaign.
