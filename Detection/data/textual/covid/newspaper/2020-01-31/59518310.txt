Public utility drivers told to wear face masks vs coronavirus 
 MANILA - All public utility vehicle drivers and conductors are required to wear face masks "at all times" while on duty as a precautionary against a new coronavirus strain that is spreading globally, transport authorities said Friday.

All PUV drivers should wear face masks while terminal operators should provide masks and sanitizer dispensers "for free use of passengers," according to a Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) memorandum released Friday.

The LTFRB "deems it necessary and urgent to devise precautionary measures to ensure safety of the riding public," the circular said.

Grab Philippines “will be requiring” drivers to wear face masks as a health precaution approved by the Department of Heath. Masks will be provided, it said in a statement.

The Philippines on Thursday confirmed its first case of the disease, a female tourist who traveled from the Chinese city of Wuhan the epicenter of the virus.

The World Health Organization declared a global emergency after the death toll topped 200 with nearly 10,000 reported cases.
