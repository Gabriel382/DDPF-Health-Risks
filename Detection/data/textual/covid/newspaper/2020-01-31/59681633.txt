Dow tumbles 400 points, briefly slips beneath its 50-day moving average as coronavirus fears spread 
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average [: DJIA] on Friday morning was under heavy selling pressure, putting the blue-chip index on the brink of breaking through a short-term moving average. The Dow was most recently down 410 points, or 1.4%, at 28,450, as coronavirus fears and the suspension of flights to China by American Airlines AAL, -3.08% and Delta Air DAL, -1.97% hurt market sentiment. The Dow's 50-day moving average stands at 28,443.30, according to FactSet data and the index briefly traded at 28,441.69, at its intraday nadir. Airlines were responding to the spread of novel coronavirus, after the World Health Organization on Thursday declared the illness-which has now sickened more than 9,500 people and killed more than 200-a public-health emergency of international concern. Stock-market analysts use moving averages as a demarcation line between bullish and bearish trends in an asset.
