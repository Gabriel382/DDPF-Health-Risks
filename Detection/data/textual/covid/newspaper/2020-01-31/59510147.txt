US urges Americans not to travel to China amid coronavirus outbreak 
 The U.S. is urging Americans not to travel to China amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 200 people in China and infected thousands worldwide.

The State Department announced Thursday evening that it had elevated its travel advisory to the highest level after the World Health Organization declared the viral outbreak an international public health emergency earlier Thursday.

The advisory instructs those currently in China to consider leaving by commercial travel, adding that the department "has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus."
