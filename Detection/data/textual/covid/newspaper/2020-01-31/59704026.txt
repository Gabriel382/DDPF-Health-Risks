Ateneo urges students and faculty from China to self-quarantine amid 2019-nCoV threat 
 MANILAâ€” Ateneo de Manila University has advised its students and faculty who visited or arrived from China to quarantine themselves for 14 days amid fears of a possible outbreak of the new coronavirus in the Philippines.

The directive was issued by university president Jose Ramon Villarin.

Students under quarantine will be excused from their classes and will be allowed to have make-up classes.

Faculty members and professionals under quarantine and handling classes or student formations are urged to have make-up classes or activities upon their return to work.

The announcement came a day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the Philippines' first case of the new coronavirus, a 38-year-old woman from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus originated.

The death toll in China from the new coronavirus reached more than 200 on Friday, with overall cases worldwide rising rapidly in an outbreak that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.
