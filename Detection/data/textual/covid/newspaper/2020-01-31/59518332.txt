DOH: No suspension of classes around San Lazaro Hospital 
 MANILA - The health department will not recommend the suspension of classes around a state hospital in Manila amid the novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the move would be "too extreme."

The San Lazaro Hospital in Sta. Cruz, Manila has been monitoring patients from China for the virus.

On Thursday, the Department of Health confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the Philippines after a woman from Wuhan, China tested positive at a government hospital in Metro Manila.

Before the first case was confirmed, a Chinese man under observation for the virus died of pneumonia at the San Lazaro Hospital Wednesday.

It has not been confirmed if the patient, who was from Yunnan, China, also carried the virus.

Several schools in Manila and in Kalibo, Aklan have suspended classes due to fears of the possible spreading of the virus.

The WHO on Thursday declared a global emergency as the outbreak had claimed the lives of 170 people in China and cases spread to 18 countries.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), according to WHO.
