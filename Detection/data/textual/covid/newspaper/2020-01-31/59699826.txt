GOP Congressman Calls For Travel Ban To China As Coronavirus Spreads 
 Republican North Carolina Rep. Ted Budd called for a travel ban to China Friday as a coronavirus continues to spread throughout the world.
 Budd, who is the first House member to come out for a full travel ban to China over the coronavirus, said it is “common sense” to call for a travel ban to China.
 
 “As this virus continues to spread, I think it’s common sense to act now in an abundance of caution,” Budd said in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “To date, nearly 10,000 people have been infected worldwide and 213 people have died. Several major airlines have already suspended flights to China, the World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency, and the State Department has urged Americans not to travel to China.”
 Budd’s comments come after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global health emergency Thursday. The coronavirus death toll hit 213 Thursday evening, according to the Chinese government. (RELATED: WHO Declares Coronavirus A Global Health Emergency)
 “We can and should go further to ensure the safety of our citizens by imposing a full ban on travel to and from China until the virus is sufficiently contained or eradicated,” Budd added. “American citizens in China should be allowed to evacuate, but under strict monitoring.”
 Republican Sens.  Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas have also called for travel bans to China to stop the spread of the disease.
