Negros Oriental gov issues EO requiring 14-day quarantine for foreigners, locals coming from China, HK 
 BACOLOD CITY—Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo on Friday issued an executive order to quarantine for 14 days all foreigners and locals arriving from China and Hong Kong.

The governor issued the EO hours after the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the country’s first novel coronavirus (nCoV) case, that of a 38-year-old Chinese woman.

Degamo said the woman had stayed in a hotel and resort in Dumaguete City.

He ordered the creation of a Hospital Incident Command System to be headed by Dr. Lilan Estacion, assistant provincial health officer.

The new body was supposed to ensure the safety of first responders, address all concerns about nCoV and coordinate with the DOH and other government agencies.

Degamo also asked the Department of Trade and Industry in Negros Oriental to inspect and monitor all outlets of protective masks to determine whether they are hoarding and overpricing the suddenly in demand products.

Facial masks in the two Negros provinces—Occidental and Oriental—are now out of stock.
