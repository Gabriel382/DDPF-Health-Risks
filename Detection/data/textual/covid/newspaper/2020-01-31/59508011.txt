 Oil Rebounds After WHO Says There’s No Need for Travel Bans

(Bloomberg) -- Oil jumped after the World Health Organization said there’s no need for travel and trade bans due to the coronavirus, but was still set for its worst month since May as the outbreak sapped the demand outlook.

The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, but said restrictions on commerce weren’t necessary and that it had confidence in China’s ability to control the virus. Crude got a further boost after a non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index in Asia’s largest economy beat estimates, helping push futures in New York up by as much as 2.3%.

Oil has fallen 9% in the last two weeks as the fast-spreading virus spurred China to lock down entire cities and curb domestic travel, while many airlines canceled flights to and from the country. Investors are bracing for a sizable hit to crude demand from the world’s biggest importer and it’s likely many of the nation’s refineries will cut operating rates or shut down entirely.

“China has said the impact of the coronavirus is not fully reflected in the January PMI and it’s too early to peer into the crystal ball,” said Howie Lee, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “Today’s spike could be a knee-jerk reaction and things could get worse before they get better.”

West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery rose 1.8% to $53.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 9:56 a.m. in Singapore. It closed down 2.2% on Thursday and has fallen around 13% so far this month.

Brent for the same month advanced 1.6% to $59.20 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange after dropping 2.5% on Thursday. It’s down around 10% in January. The global crude benchmark traded at a $6.15 a barrel premium to WTI.
