Facebook joins Google and Twitter in cracking down on fake coronavirus 'cures' and other misinformation 
 The company will "remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them," according to a blog post published Thursday by Kang-Xing Jin, Facebook's head of health.

Jin said that includes claims "related to false cures or prevention methods" or "that create confusion about health resources that are available."

The company also plans to increase its fact-checking and monitoring efforts on Instagram, which it also owns. Jin said users who click on a hashtag related to the coronavirus will now be served with a "pop-up with credible information."

The social network wants to prioritize legitimate sources of information, Jin said, by letting select organizations run free ads that help educate people about the virus and also boosting posts that fall in line with health experts' guidance to the top of users' Facebook feeds. It did not specify which organizations would be included.
