Virus prevention

The outbreak of the novel and deadly Coronavirus in China has become a serious danger for Pakistan. The fatal virus also seems to have spread to other countries like the US, France and the UK. However, given the substantial Chinese immigrant population in Pakistan and the frequent travel between China and Pakistan, the danger of the virus spreading to our shores looms large.
It is good to know that the government has taken swift and commendable steps by installing virus detection scanners at airports. In addition, the media has a crucial role to play in spreading awareness of this virus and its preventive measures.
