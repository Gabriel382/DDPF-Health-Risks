Wuhan virus: February will be pivotal in determining success of containment efforts, says expert 
 SINGAPORE - The weeks ahead will be pivotal for scientists looking to determine the severity and virulence of the novel coronavirus originating from Wuhan, infectious diseases expert Peter Piot said on Friday (Jan 31).

"The month of February is going to be very critical, and will tell us if the outbreak is going to much bigger or not," Professor Piot, a Belgian microbiologist who co-discovered the Ebola virus, told The Straits Times in an interview.
