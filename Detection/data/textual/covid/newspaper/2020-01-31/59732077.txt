Trump bans foreign nationals who have traveled to China from entering the US 
 Any foreign national who has traveled within China in the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter the United States, according to a proclamation from President Trump. The action is to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, said US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar announced today. 

Any US citizen who has traveled in China will undergo health screening on entry into the country and be asked to self quarantine for 14 days. US citizens who have traveled to Hubei province, where the virus originated, will be held under mandatory quarantine for 14 days after they return to the US. 

The policies will take effect Sunday, February 2 at 5 p.m.
