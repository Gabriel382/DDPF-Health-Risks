Ant and Dec confirm Saturday night Takeaway return after axing series last year 
 Ant and Dec are officially back for the next series of Saturday Night Takeaway, which will be on our screens in February.

The ITV stars confirmed the news with a trailer marking their return to the stage – after last year’s instalment was pulled last year over 44-year-old Ant McPartlin’s drink-driving arrest.

And the pair dropped the all-singing, all-dancing teaser on Twitter.

It begins with the hosts rewatching the 2018 series, as Ant asks: ‘Do you really think we can make the new series of Saturday Night Takeaway the best ever?

‘Of course we can. We can can,’ Declan Donnelly, 44, replies, before breaking out into song.

Recalling their epic Disney adventure from 2018, they promised even more star guests, surprises and actual prizes.

Fans were thrilled to have the duo back on the SNT stage, flooding their post with praise.

While one replied: ‘Finally….actually can’t wait! It will be amazing! Good luck but you won’t need it. Xx.’

‘Ah I can’t wait! I love watching SNT with my kids, it makes us smile from start to finish every time,’ another posted.

‘There is no better way to spend a Saturday eve.’

Saturday Night Takeaway was taken off air last year when Ant stepped back from the limelight, after his arrest in 2017.

He was fined £86,000 and given a 20-month driving ban following the crash in Richmond, which involved his Mini and two other cars.

After taking time off from work, he returned to work alongside Declan Donnelly for last year’s Britain’s Got Talent and I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here.

‘There’s a real buzz around the show,’ a source teased about the show’s return back last August.

‘It promises to be bigger and better than ever.’
