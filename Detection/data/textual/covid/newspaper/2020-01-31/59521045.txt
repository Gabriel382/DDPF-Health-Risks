Chinese Authorities Send Charter Flights Globally to Return Wuhan Residents - Foreign Ministry 
 The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday that Beijing prepared special charter flights to return Wuhan residents from abroad to the epicenter of the virus-hit Hubei province.

The Chinese aviation watchdog earlier green-lighted the drafting of charter flights for domestic air carriers to bring Chinese tourists from abroad back to the mainland over the rapidly spreading outbreak.

The 11 million people of the city of Wuhan have de-facto been cordoned off from the other provinces. Public transportation services have reportedly been suspended in the city. Air and ground transport with the rest of mainland China has been cut off.

Authorities have globally suspended air traffic to and from China, increased border and airport control, and put travelers with even slight traces of flu symptoms into isolated wards under quarantine.

The number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus has already surpassed the number of cases of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2002-2003 outbreak, caused by another type of coronavirus.
