UPDATE: DOH clarifies, 56 ‘nCoV-related events,’ not patients being monitored 
 MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Health said Friday that there are now 56 “nCoV-related health events” a day after it confirmed that a Chinese woman who traveled from Wuhan in China and is being treated at a hospital in Manila has tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

DOH epidemiology bureau head Dr. Ferchito Avelino made this clarification after he earlier said there are 56 patients under investigation on suspicion that they have been infected with the novel coronavirus.



“Currently we have I think 56 if I am not mistaken. It’s 56 patients under investigation,” DOH epidemiology bureau head Dr. Ferchito Avelino earlier said in an interview with CNN Philippines’ The Source.

But in a later text message to INQUIRER.net, he said the 56 are only “events” related to the novel coronavirus. He has yet to explain what he meant by “events.”

He said that of this number, 29 patients are being investigated on suspicion that they have the virus, this was also confirmed by Health Secretary Francisco Duque on Thursday.

Out of the 29 patients, 18 are in Metro Manila, four are in Central Visayas, three are in Western Visayas, and one each in Mimaropa, Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao, and Davao Region.

The country’s first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus infection was a 38-year-old Chinese woman who came from Wuhan City in China, the epicenter of the outbreak, and is now being treated at San Lazaro Hospital in Manila.

Avelino said the woman is now “well” but was having an “occasional cough.”
