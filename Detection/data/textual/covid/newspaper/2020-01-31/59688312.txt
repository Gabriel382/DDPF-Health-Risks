'Panic-selling' reached on the stock market as coronavirus sparks Friday tumble

The Arms index on the NYSE hit around 2.2 Friday midday. The index is a volume-weighted breadth measure, that tends to rise when the broader market falls, as the intensity of the selling in declining stocks is usually greater than the intensity of buying in rising stocks. Levels above 2.000 are considered panic-like activity. The Dow was down 446 points, or 1.6%, at 28,416, below its 50-day moving average at 28,443.30. The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.20% was sinking 1.4% at 3,237, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.01% was down 1.2% at 9,184.
