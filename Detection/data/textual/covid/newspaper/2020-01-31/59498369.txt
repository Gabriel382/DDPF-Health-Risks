Australia's coronavirus outbreak 
 NATIONAL
* Nine people have contracted the virus after travelling to Australia from Hubei province in central China.
* Authorities say the Australian cases have been relatively mild, with two patients discharged from hospital in NSW
* NSW has had four confirmed cases, Victoria three, and Queensland two. All patients are stable
THE WORLD:
* The World Health Organisation has declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency but says containment is still possible
* China has 9,692 confirmed coronavirus cases and 213 have died, all of them in China
* There are 98 confirmed cases of infection outside mainland China in at least 18 countries including the nine Australian cases, along with cases in Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, the US and France
* The US has reported its first case of person-to-person transmission; Germany, Vietnam and Japan have also recorded similar transmissions, which suggest greater potential for the virus to spread further
AUSTRALIA'S EVACUATION PLANS:
* Australia is yet to secure China's permission to evacuate up to 600 citizens and residents from Hubei's capital, Wuhan
* But federal Health Minister Greg Hunt says "significant" progress is being made
THE CHRISTMAS ISLAND QUARANTINE CENTRE
* The first Australian Medical Assistance Teams will arrive on Christmas Island on Friday
* Australian evacuees from China's virus zone will be kept in quarantine there for two weeks
* The island's field hospital will be set to provide critical care, including a negative pressure room and isolation capacity
FLIGHTS FROM CHINA:
* Australia will not ban inbound flights from China at this stage, but flights from the virus epicentre of Wuhan have been halted
* The World Health Organisation has not recommended nations ban flights from China
* If Australia's Health Protection Principal Committee changes its position and recommends banning flights, the federal government has said it will act on that advice
AUSTRALIA'S LAST FLIGHT FROM WUHAN:
* Authorities have traced every passenger that arrived in Australia on the last flight allowed to land from Wuhan a week ago
* Some of the confirmed cases involved people on that flight
* All passengers on that flight have been ordered to isolate themselves
TRAVEL WARNINGS:
* The Australian government is advising people to reconsider travel to China and not go to Hubei province
