Tucker Carlson Rips CNN: "Wokeness Is A Virus; It's Infectious, It Destroys Your Brain" 
 TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS: As you've just heard, the Coronavirus is a serious, serious threat, certainly potentially, and authorities are taking it seriously in this and other countries.

 

 But over on CNN, still calling itself a news channel even as of tonight, here's what the story means -- and we're going to read this tweet: "Coronavirus task force another example of the Trump administration's lack of diversity."

 

 Then, they include the picture just to let you know that it's the wrong color. The people working to protect you from Coronavirus, this is CNN's take away, are the wrong color.

 

 Speaking of viruses, wokeness is a virus. It's infectious, it destroys your brain, you are watching it happen to people all around you, certainly on the left, some running for president, many working at CNN. You wind up writing stuff like that once you're infected. Totally insane.
