U.K. reports its first two cases of coronavirus 
 The U.K. Department of Health and Social Care on Friday confirmed the country's first two cases of coronavirus, both from the same family. "The patients are receiving specialist NHS care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus," said Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, in a statement. "The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread." The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the coronavirus a global emergency. China has reported 9,692 confirmed cases with a death toll of 213 as of Friday.
