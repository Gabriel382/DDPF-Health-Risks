American Airlines Suspends All Chinese Flights After Coronavirus Threat Level Increased 
 FORT WORTH (CBSDFW.COM) – Earlier this week American Airlines greatly reduced the number of flights transporting passengers to and from China. Today the company shutdown all Chinese inbound and outbound traffic because of the coronavirus threat.

The Fort Worth-based carrier said they made the decision after the U.S. Department of State increased the China Travel Advisory to a Level 4 — Do Not Travel.

The airline issued a statement that said, in part:

“American is suspending its operations to and from the Chinese mainland beginning today through March 27.

We will continue to evaluate the schedule for March 28 and beyond and make any adjustments as necessary.”

Officials with the company said teams are contacting affected customers directly and will assist in anyway they can to accommodate their needs.
