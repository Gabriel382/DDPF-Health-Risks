Salomon Rondon makes Man Utd transfer decision amid China coronavirus crisis 
 Reports originally suggested that the former Newcastle striker had emerged as a loan option for United.
United have also failed in their attempts to sign PSG’s Edinson Cavani, who will probably stay in Paris now.
Ex-Watford star Odion Ighalo is also an option for United, with The Athletic reporting that he’s the Red Devils next target.
Ighalo also plays in the Chinese Super League but he’s not in China at the moment, as he’s also away in training camp with his team-mates.
