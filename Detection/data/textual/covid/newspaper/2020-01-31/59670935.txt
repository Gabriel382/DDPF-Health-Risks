Delta will suspend all China flights starting Feb. 6 as coronavirus outbreak spreads 
 Delta Air Lines on Friday announced it would suspend its remaining service to and from China next month as the rapid spread of coronavirus cuts into demand.

The Atlanta-based carrier's service suspension will begin Feb. 6 and last through April 30, but will continue to operate the service until then to "ensure customers looking to exit China have options to do so."

Dozens of carriers around the world including Delta's U.S. competitors United and American have slashed or suspended service to China because of the outbreak. Large companies spanning industries from technology to packaged food have suspended business trips to the country because of coronavirus, driving down demand for flights to China.
