METALS-Copper poised for biggest monthly fall since May on virus fears 
 SINGAPORE, Jan 31 (Reuters) - London copper prices rose on Friday, but were on track for their biggest monthly decline in eight months as the coronavirus epidemic raised fears of a slowdown in demand from top metals consumer China. 
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) has fallen 8.9% so far in the month, on course for its sharpest drop since May 2019. 
The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the virus outbreak a global health emergency, with the death toll in China reaching 213 on Friday and the number of confirmed cases rising to 9,692. 
London copper, often used as a gauge of economic health, has lost some 10% since the virus started making headlines last week. However, it rose 0.6% to $5,623.50 a tonne by 0515 GMT on Friday after 12 straight sessions of losses. 
China is the world’s biggest copper consumer and a major user of many other metals. Fears that the epidemic would stall economic activities have dented metals demand. 
Growth in China’s factory activity faltered in January as export orders fell, with the Purchasing Managers’ Index falling to 50.0 in January from 50.2 in December.
