Dow S&P 500 open lower Friday on coronavirus angst but Nasdaq pops higher as Amazon's stock soars 
 Stock indexes opened mostly lower Friday morning, with the three main benchmarks set to post weekly declines, as the coronavirus epidemic that began in China continued to sow the seeds of uncertainty among investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.68% fell 200 points, or 0.7%, at 28,654, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.41% declined 0.4% at 3,271, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.15% traded flat as sharers of Amazon.com Inc. jumped at the open. At last check, China has reported over 9,600 cases of coronavirus, while the death toll has climbed to 213, a day after the World Health Organization declared the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern, but didn't call for a restriction of trade and movement. In economic news, consumer spending rose modestly in December to cap off a decent holiday shopping season, but the increase in outlays in 2019 was the smallest in three years, the government reported. Among Dow components reporting on Friday, Chevron CVX, -2.70% fell 1.1% after revenues fell short of Wall Street estimates. While, oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp's XOM, -3.12% stock was trading lower after its fourth-quarter profit and revenues came below analyst forecasts. Meanwhile, International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +3.45% late Thursday said Chief Executive Ginni Rometty will retire at the end of the year. Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -1.53% reported a fourth-quarter profit that came in well above expectations but sales fell short and the construction- and mining-equipment maker offered a downbeat outlook. Meanwhile, Amazon.com Inc.'s shares AMZN, +7.87% jumped as the e-commerce and cloud-computing juggernaut delivered results that were better than expected.
