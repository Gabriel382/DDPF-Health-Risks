                    A pointing Boris Johnson, delivering his pre-recorded Brexit day address, features on some of the day's front pages. The PM will "hail the dawn of a new era" in his speech, says the Daily Telegraph. That era will begin, the paper says, with a tax cut to give workers an "immediate Brexit bounce". And US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told the paper that a "gold standard" trans-Atlantic trade agreement can be agreed.

                    The Guardian strikes a less optimistic tone. The headline "small island" leans against a picture of the white cliffs of Dover. The UK has made its "biggest gamble in a generation", the paper says.

                    Those same famous cliffs are pictured on the Daily Mail's front page, underneath the booming headline: "A new dawn for Britain". The paper says the UK will remain a "friend of Europe, but free and independent once more".

                    "Thirty years of resistance to the creeping danger of a European state", will come to a head when Big Ben hits 23:00 GMT, the Sun says. In its front page leader, the paper hails the "birth of a new Britain". Now, the UK's "course changes for ever", the paper says, "and for the better".

                    "We did it!" declares the Daily Express, which has long campaigned for the UK to leave the EU. To highlight that point, the front page features an outline of the UK, tiled with the paper's earlier Brexit-focused editions. The paper also previews Mr Johnson's speech, saying that the PM will "herald a new era of renewal and change".

                    For the i, Brexit represents a "leap into the unknown". The paper says that questions over the UK's diplomatic and trading future remain "unresolved", at a time when the Bank of England has cut its growth forecast for the UK economy.

                    Mr Johnson will look to secure a new UK-EU trade deal based on the one agreed between the EU and Canada, reports the Times. However, three EU leaders have told the paper that the bloc will reject any such move unless the UK signs up to EU rules.

                    Mr Johnson will "vow to the nation to restore unity", says the Metro, which counts the days since the EU referendum result was announced: 1,317. Away from Brexit, the paper reports that Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand, Goop, has been criticised by a UK health official.

                    As if to summarise the day's front pages, the Financial Times suggests Brexit day will be met with a "mixture of optimism and regret". While Brexit-supporters party in central London, there will be "profound sadness" for others, the FT says. Mr Johnson will set a sober tone, says the paper, and will focus on Leave-voting regions, such as Sunderland where he will hold a Cabinet meeting later.

                    The Mirror says Brexit day is the time to bring the country "back together". Its lead story, meanwhile, focuses on coronavirus. The paper pictures what it says are staff delivering equipment to an "isolation point" in the Wirral, Merseyside, ahead of the arrival of about 150 UK citizens from the Wuhan area, where the virus is thought to have originated.

                    For the Daily Star, today's date holds a different significance "...it's the end of dry January!"
