Jake Paul wears sparkly gas mask for Gib ring walk after brother Logan jokes about coronavirus with porn star Riley Reid 
 JAKE PAUL wore a sparkly gas mask for his ring walk before fighting AnEsonGib - just after brother Logan joked about the coronavirus with porn star Riley Reid.

Logan - who was beaten by YouTube rival KSI by split-decision in November - travelled to Miami to watch little bro Jake make his pro debut.

On the way the 24-year-old social media star posted on Instagram: “f**k the corona virus”.

He did so posing topless next to adult film star Reid as well as glamour models including Julia Rose - who once flashed at a baseball game - with all of them wearing gas marks.

Jake kept up the trend as he walked to the ring before smashing Gib in one round with a gold mask that had Louis Vuitton printed around it.

KSI was ringside to watch his best friend get hopelessly beaten and confronted Jake in the ring after, with the two now certain to keep the trend of novice YouTubers fighting for lots of money as professional boxers.

Jake twice forced Gib to touch the canvas with his gloves before the ref finally stopped the one-sided bout with 40 seconds remaining.

But the 22-year-old American was disappointed he didn't get to showcase his full “boxing ability” over more rounds.

Jake said: “That was lit. I'm taking a moment to soak it in, I caught the boxing bug, I put the work in and I'm in love with this sport.

“My power and speed took him out in the first round.

“I dedicated the last five months of my life to this, I sacrificed everything for this. You all said this was my best competitor and I silenced him in one round.

“I didn't even get to showcase my boxing ability.

“I think the first knockdown was with the jab which is something we worked on.

“My coach said he thought it was going in one and we visualised a first-round knockout for two months.”
