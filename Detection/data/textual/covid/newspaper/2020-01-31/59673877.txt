WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc said Friday it will temporarily suspend all remaining U.S.-China flights after the U.S. State Department elevated a travel advisory over concerns about the coronavirus. 
The United States told citizens on Thursday not to travel to China due to an epidemic that has infected nearly 10,000 people and been declared a global emergency. 
Pilots and flight attendants have been demanding airlines stop flights to the country, with American Airlinesâ€™ pilots filing a lawsuit on Thursday seeking an immediate halt. 
Delta said earlier this week it was halving its U.S.-China schedule to about 21 weekly flights. 
In a statement on Friday, Delta said the last China-bound flight departing the U.S. will leave on Monday, Feb. 3 with the last return flight back to the U.S. departing China on Feb. 5. The suspension is set to last through April 30.
