Kenya Airways suspends flights to China amid coronavirus outbreak 
 The carrier, which operates direct flights to Guangzhou, said it's monitoring the situation with Kenya's health and foreign ministries.

In a statement, officials with the airline said, "The safety of our customers and staff remains our highest priority."

Many Kenyans had expressed concerns about the carrier's flights to the Asian country when a passenger who had arrived from Guangzhou was quarantined after showing symptoms of coronavirus Tuesday.

The passenger was a student who had traveled from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak. The test result was negative, according to the Kenya health ministry on Friday.
