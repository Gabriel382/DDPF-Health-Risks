China Reports Nearly 10,000 Coronavirus Cases 
 China says it has nearly 10,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. The virus has caused 213 deaths in China where it emerged late last year.

The World Health Organization says the worldwide spread of the virus is a global health emergency, as well as an "extraordinary event" requiring a coordinated international response.

The Trump administration is warning Americans not to travel to China. The State Department issued what it calls a Level 4-Do Not Travel advisory. It also is recommending all those currently in China to leave. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued Tuesday a Level 3 notice, advising Americans to avoid all nonessential travel to China.

Britain reported its first confirmed cases Friday. "We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus," said Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England.Â  He said the two are receiving "specialist" care from the country's National Health Service.

India and Philippines have also confirmed their first cases, joining a growing list that includes Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand, The United Arab Emirates and Vietnam.
