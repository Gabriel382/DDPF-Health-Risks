Coronavirus - China’s first patient, 23, to recover paraded for the cameras during bizarre press conference 
 THE FIRST person to be infected with coronavirus was brought out in front of journalists to praise his government in a strange press conference in China today.

Wearing a mask, glasses and a hood, patient zero told the crowd he was “fully confident” in the country’s medical abilities.

The 23-year-old man has been cured of the virus, which has so far killed 212 and infected at least 7,700 across 17 countries, after travelling to Wuhan in China.

He said: “It’s the first time this kind of thing happened to me. I didn’t know how it would develop later.

He was hospitalised on January 20 after he developed a fever.

He added: “But I was fully confident for our nation and its medical level. Now I feel very well physically and I also feel quite happy.”

“I’m very thankful for the care and support I got from the hospital and provincial government.”



Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars).

Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while others - like the one that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) - are far more severe.

In most cases, you won't know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.

But if a coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract (your windpipe and your lungs), it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or those with weakened immune systems.

There is no vaccine for coronavirus.
