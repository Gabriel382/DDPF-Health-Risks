Coronavirus threat: Student shifted to hospital in Karachi after returning from China 
 KARACHI (Dunya News) – A Pakistani student has been shifted to the isolation ward at the Aga Khan Hospital, Karachi as a precautionary measure against the new coronavirus following his return from China, Dunya News reported on Friday.

The student, Arslan, was residing in Wuhan where the virus originated and sample of his nose fluid has been sent to Islamabad’s National Institute of Health for testing. Arslan will presumably be discharged from the hospital if his report is negative.

According to experts, symptoms of the coronavirus do not appear in some patients; however, they can transfer it to others. It is pertinent here to mention that the National Institute of Health can conduct tests of up to 1000 samples after receiving the coronavirus testing kits from Japan.

On the other hand, the World Health Organization declared a global emergency over coronavirus, as China reported Friday the death toll had climbed to 213 with nearly 10,000 infections. The UN health agency based in Geneva had initially downplayed the threat posed by the disease, but revised its risk assessment after crisis talks.
