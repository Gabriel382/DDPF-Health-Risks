SBMA orders quarantine of 2 Chinese businessmen 
 SUBIC BAY FREEPORT –– Two Chinese officials of a company here were subjected to quarantine shortly after arriving from Henan, China via Clark International Airport, authorities said on Friday.

Wilma Eisma, chair of Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA), said the two Chinese did not show symptoms of novel coronavirus infection but were still placed in isolation at an unknown facility inside the free port, to ensure they would not pose health risks.

“They [Chinese businessmen] were cleared in Clark Airport. [But] the Bureau of Quarantine and my occupational health team are monitoring them. Better safe than sorry,” Eisma told the Inquirer in a text message.

She said since SBMA has no facilities for quarantine, the two Chinese locators are being monitored in their company’s quarantine station./lzb
