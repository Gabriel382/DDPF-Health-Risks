It's 'appalling' to quarantine people on Christmas Island: Greens politician 
 It’s “appalling” to quarantine people who may have contracted the coronavirus on Christmas Island according to NSW Greens politician David Shoebridge. Australians who are trapped in China in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak have the option of taking a chartered flight out of the country as long as they spend two weeks in quarantine on Christmas Island to ensure they do not have the potentially deadly disease. Around 600 Australians are thought to be stuck in the Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the virus that has so far claimed the lives of 213 people and infected nearly 9,100 individuals in China alone. The government has defended its decision, with Home Affairs minister telling reporters earlier this week Christmas Island is the only facility that can accommodate “many hundreds” of cases. Mr Shoebridge told Sky News host Chris Kenny it’s not appropriate to evacuate people “to a stand-alone prison in the Indian Ocean". “We should give them first class medical treatment if they need it, and you can’t get that on Christmas Island,” he said. “If they need medical treatment, they should be brought into one of our first class medical hospitals”.
