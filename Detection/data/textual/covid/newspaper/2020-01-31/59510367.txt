US State Department Issues 'Level 4' Travel Alert For China, Urging People to Abstain From Visiting 
 The US Department of State, following Thursday's notice about the voluntary evacuation for non-emergency diplomatic staffers and their families in China, has updated its travel advisory for Americans, issuing "Level 4: Do Not Travel Alert".

“Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. On January 30, the World Health Organization has determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China”, the Department of State said in a statement on late Thursday. The US citizens, who are currently in China, have been asked to leave the country.
