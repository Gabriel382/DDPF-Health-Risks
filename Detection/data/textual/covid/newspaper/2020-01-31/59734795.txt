Man United hold talks over surprise loan move for ex-Watford striker Odion Ighalo 
 Manchester United have held talks over former Watford striker Odion Ighalo. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also said he expected no further business after they brought in Nathan Bishop from League One strugglers Southend, but it is understood a temporary arrival does remain possible. United expressed an interest in Bournemouth's Josh King, although preferred a loan deal and were unable to reach an agreement on a permanent transfer. Talks have been held over Shanghai Shenhua striker Ighalo, but the time difference and the travel situation due to the coronavirus are just some of the issues to contend with. Edinson Cavani, another striker linked with United and also Chelsea, will remain at Paris St Germain until at least the summer. Cavani's expected move to Atletico Madrid fell through and PSG boss Thomas Tuchel has confirmed the Uruguayan could feature for his side in Saturday's home Ligue 1 clash with Montpellier.
