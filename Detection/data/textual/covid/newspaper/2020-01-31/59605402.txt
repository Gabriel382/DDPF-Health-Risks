Deadly coronavirus confirmed in the UK - all you need to know 
 Two members of the same family have tested positive for coronavirus in England.

The first cases of the virus to be diagnosed in the UK were announced as more than 80 Britons on an evacuation flight from the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak were due to land in the UK.

The Department of Health declined to say where in England the patients were from but it is understood they are not in the Wirral area, where a special facility has been set up to quarantine those returning from Wuhan.

At least 213 people in China have died from the virus, mostly in Hubei, with almost 10,000 cases nationally and 98 cases across another 18 countries.
