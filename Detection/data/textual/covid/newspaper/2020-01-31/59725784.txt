The Trump administration will hold a briefing about the coronavirus outbreak Friday afternoon at the White House.

It will involve members of President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force, which includes national security advisor Robert O'Brien, Health Secretary Alex Azar and other leading officials. It is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. ET.

Earlier Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quarantined 195 Americans who have been evacuated from Wuhan, China.

Also Friday, U.S. airlines including Delta, United and American announced they would suspend all remaining service to mainland China after a State Department warning put a damper on demand for flights there.

Airlines have said ticket sales for China have dropped sharply, a trend that will likely dent their first-quarter revenues.

Dozens of other large U.S. corporations, including Apple, Ford and Kraft Heinz, have already restricted their employees' China business travel or scaled back operations because of the outbreak.

Here are the members of the coronavirus task force:

Robert O'Brien, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Dr. Robert Redfield, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health Joel Szabat, Acting Under Secretary for Policy, Department of Transportation Matthew Pottinger, Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor Rob Blair, Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff Joseph Grogan, Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy Council Christopher Liddell, Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Coordination
