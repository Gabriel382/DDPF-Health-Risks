Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is declared in the case of some “serious public health events” that may endanger international public health. Under the International Health Regulations (IHR), a public health emergency is defined as “an extraordinary event" that constitutes "a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease; and to potentially require a coordinated international response”. The Indian Embassy in Beijing has alerted Indian nationals in Wuhan that it is preparing for evacuation this evening. “This flight will carry those Indian nationals who are in and around Wuhan and have conveyed consent for their evacuation. There will be another flight subsequently which will carry those who are from other parts of Hubei Province,” the Indian Embassy said in a message to the Indian community.
