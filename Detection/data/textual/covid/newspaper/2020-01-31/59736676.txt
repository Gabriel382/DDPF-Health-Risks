Santa Clara County Health Officials Confirm First Bay Area Coronavirus Case 
 SANTA CLARA COUNTY (CBS SF) â€” Officials with the Santa Clara County Public Health Department on Friday received confirmation from the CDC that an adult male resident of the county has tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

The test is the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus that first emerged in the Chinese city and province of Wuhan two months ago.

Santa Clara County officials are planning a press conference to offer more details on the case at 2 p.m. Friday.

Earlier Friday, the novel coronavirus was declared a public health emergency in the United States, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a White House briefing.

After the declaration goes into effect at 5 p.m. EST on Sunday, US citizens returning to the United States who have been in Hubei, China, province in the 14 days prior will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine, Azar said.

US citizens who have been in the rest of mainland China in the 14 days prior will face a health screening at a select number of ports of entry, he said. Those citizens also face up to two weeks of monitored self-quarantine to ensure they pose no health risk.
