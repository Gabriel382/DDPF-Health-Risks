WHO declares coronavirus outbreak 'global health emergency' 
 WHO, 신종코로나 비상 선포... "교역, 여행 제한 반대"



The WHO responded as the virus spreads outside of China.

A decision was made to declare a global public health emergency.

Kim Jae-hee tells us more.

The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern."

The director-general for the WHO said on Thursday during a news conference in Geneva,... that the main reason for the declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.

"I'm declaring a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of novel coronavirus. The greatest concern is deportation for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill prepared to deal with it."

He also stressed that the WHO continues to have confidence in China's capacity to control the epidemic,... and that there's no need at this time for measures that interfere with travel and trade.

The WHO declares international health emergencies for only "extraordinary" events that cause health risks to other countries by spreading internationally,... and potentially require a coordinated international response.

The declaration alerts WHO member countries to step up precautionary measures, such as screening travelers and monitoring international trade.

This is the sixth time such an emergency has been declared by the WHO.
