PH checks if first coronavirus patient frolicked in Cebu 
 Authorities are checking if the Philippines' first novel coronavirus patient had stayed or merely passed by Cebu province, a local official said Friday.

The 38-year-old female patient came from the Chinese central city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected. From Wuhan, she took flights to Hong Kong, Cebu and Dumaguete, before arriving in Manila on Jan. 21, said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III. 

  

 "Iyong information na sinabi sa amin kahapon, napadaan lang siya [sa Cebu]. But sinisiguro lang na talagang hindi siya nag-stay at kung nag-stay siya, san siya nag-stay, may mga nakasama ba siya doon, at kung part ba siya ng isang tour group," said the province's port commissioner Mike Acebedo Lopez.

Travelers from China would be placed on a 14-day quarantine in the province to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Cebu Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia said Thursday.

President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday banned travelers from China's Hubei province, which includes Wuhan.
