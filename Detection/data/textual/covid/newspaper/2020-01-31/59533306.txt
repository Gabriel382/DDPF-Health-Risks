Jetstar passengers left sitting on tarmac for two hours after coronavirus scare 
 Passengers on a Jetstar flight from Melbourne to Hobart were left sitting on a tarmac for more than two hours after a man on the plane became ill, raising concerns he may have coronavirus.

The flight from Melbourne arrived at the Hobart Airport about 2:35pm, when passengers were advised they would have to wait to disembark due to a passenger illness.

Just before 5:00pm, the captain informed travellers the passenger had a suspected case of coronavirus.

"[We had a] passenger from China, who after take-off advised cabin crew that he was not feeling well," the captain said.

"Now with the coronavirus going on at the moment, these issues are quite sensitive."

He said the passengers would be handed a letter from the Health Department as they disembark the plane and that their details would be collected.

"There is a very low risk of infection," the captain said.

A Jetstar spokesperson confirmed the passenger reported feeling unwell towards the end of the flight.

"As a precaution â€¦ the captain asked [the] ambulance to meet the aircraft on arrival and attend to the passenger," they said.
