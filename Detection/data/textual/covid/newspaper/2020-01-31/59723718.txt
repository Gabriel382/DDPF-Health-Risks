Arshad Warsi slammed for 'racist' Munna Bhai MBBS meme on curbing the spread of Coronavirus - Times of India 
 Actor and funnyman 
Arshad Warsi, known for his humorous role as the sidekick Circuit in the movie '
Munna Bhai MBBS', attempted to be chucklesome while cracking a joke about the deadly 
Coronavirus outbreak. Putting together a meme from his film, the actor shared "steps to follow to stop Coronavirus from spreading."


However, the joke didn't seem to go down too well with fans and social media users who demanded that the tweet be taken down owing to its 'racist' and 'insensitive' nature.


The meme featured a scene from Munna Bhai MBBS which saw his character, Circuit conning an Asian tourist, beating him up and presenting him to 
Sanjay Dutt's character to perform a medical examination.


“My friend just sent me this very valuable info,” Arshad wrote in his tweet.


 


While some humoured themselves with the joke, others took offence, considering that the virus has claimed 213 lives in China till date. There have also been more than 9,600 confirmed cases attributed to the novel corona virus infection, reports state. 


Slamming the actor for his callous remark, a user tweeted, “Racist remark...pls delete this one.” 


“Delete immediately. We can’t be racist and support attacks on Chinese nationals. Most of the northeasterners will be targeted because of this stupid meme,” read another tweet.


Another said, “This is racist actually! Everywhere around people are putting notices to not let the Chinese in which is very absurd.” 


Here's how netizens reacted to the tweet:
