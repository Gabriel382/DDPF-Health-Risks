LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will send another plane to the virus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan to pick up British citizens if necessary, senior minister Michael Gove said on Friday. 
“If we need to do so, then we will,” Gove said, when asked by Sky News if Britain would send a second aircraft. 
Earlier on Friday a plane carrying 83 British and 27 foreign nationals flew out Wuhan, the centre of a coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 200 people and infected more than 9,000, the British government said.
