Boris Johnson steps off a plane on the same day coronavirus was confirmed in the city 
 This video shows the moment Boris Johnson steps off a plane in Newcastle - on the same day coronavirus was confirmed in the city.

The PM jetted into Newcastle Airport this morning and was filmed by a student disembarking on a private section of the runway before being driven away.

Ellie Furness, 17, recorded the footage through a college window that overlooked the site just after 11.30am today (Fri).

And as several security staff and photographers initially got off, speculation mounted among the students about the VIP visitor on board.
