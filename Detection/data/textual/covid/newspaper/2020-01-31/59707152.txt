Eighty-three Britons and 27 foreign nationals who were trapped in Wuhan return to the UK 
 Staff at RAF Brize Norton are preparing for the arrival of British nationals who have been trapped in Wuhan, China following the coronavirus outbreak.

A plane carrying 150 Britons and 50 EU nationals is expected to land at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire early this afternoon.

The flight had been scheduled to leave China at 07:00 local time (23:00 GMT Thursday) but was delayed after a lack of clearance from Chinese authorities.

Military doctors are onboard the chartered plane in case immediate treatment is necessary, although any passengers displaying symptoms of the virus have been barred from boarding.
