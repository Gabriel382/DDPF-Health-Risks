Dow tumbles 450 points at low, breaks beneath its 50-day moving average as coronavirus fears spread 
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average [: DJIA] on Friday morning was under heavy selling pressure, pushing the index through its short-term moving average.

Delta said Friday it is suspending all U.S. to China flights from Feb. 6 through April 30. The Dow's 50-day moving average stands at 28,443.30, according to FactSet data and the index briefly traded at 28,385.54, at its intraday nadir. The Dow hasn't closed below its 50-day MA since since Oct. 9.
