 Supplied video on January 31, 2020. Health Minister Greg Hunt responds to Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's claims the government isn't sharing international flight records that would reveal the locations of Chinese travellers who may be infected with coronavirus. Hunt says all information the federal government has is passed onto state leaders. "I would like to confirm that the Tiger Air flight manifest, the emails and contact numbers and other known details were provided to Queensland at 4pm yesterday," Hunt says.
