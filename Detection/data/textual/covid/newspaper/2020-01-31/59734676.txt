Azar reassured Americans that there was still a low risk of the disease spreading significantly into the United States, but that precautions were necessary.

“The risk of infection for Americans remains low and with these and our previous actions we are working to keep the risks low,” he stated.

United States citizens who have been in China in the last 14 days will undergo health screening and up to 14 days of monitored self-quarantine.

Any United States citizen who has traveled in the Hubei province of China in the last 14 days faces a mandatory quarantine of up to two weeks.
