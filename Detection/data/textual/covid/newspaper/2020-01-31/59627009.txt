Cannot 'blame people for being suspicious' of China during coronavirus outbreak 
 Sky News contributor Mike Jeffreys says he “wouldn’t trust anything coming out of” Xi Xingping’s China as the Chinese government releases updated numbers of the cases of coronavirus in the country. Director of the Australian Animal Health Authority Trevor Drew said the virus could become more deadly as it spreads, and the two per cent death rate could be misleading as there is a potential for it to “evolve rapidly and gain potency”. Mr Jeffreys told Sky News host Jane Marwick there has been “reactive management for the people in charge in China” and as a result he does not “blame people for being suspicious”. “I don’t think the Chinese government has come out of this at all well,” Mr Jeffreys said.
