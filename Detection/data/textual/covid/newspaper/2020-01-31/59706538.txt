Cages of supplies, including children’s toys, Xboxes and Barbie dolls, were spotted being wheeled across the car park today.

Food packages were also stacked up on trolleys, with baby baths on others, while boxes of phone handsets were also moved into the hospital.

It comes as the rescue flight from Wuhan finally touched down in Britain this lunchtime.

Two patients have been quarantined in Newcastle after testing positive for the killer bug - as the rescue flight from Wuhan finally touched down in Britain.

Authorities are now desperately scrambling to contain the spiralling epidemic with fears up to 2,000 could be infected in the UK.


It comes as...



Live footage showed a woman and a young child disembarking from the plane after it touched down just after 1.30pm today.

The child walked down the steps before being scooped up and carried away.

All patients will be made to be as comfortable as possible and have access to a team of medical staff who will closely monitor their condition.

There will be laundry facilities put on as well as kitchen and food available for those who wish to self-cater – completely free of charge.

The NHS will also ensure that all families are kept together with no parents being separated from their children.

A frantic hunt is now underway to track down anyone who came into contact with Britain's first coronavirus victims - as the hotel where they fell ill remains OPEN today.

The pair - believed to be Chinese tourists - were rushed to hospital suffering coronavirus-symptoms after staying at the Staycity aparthotel in York city centre on Wednesday.

Dramatic video footage showed hazmat paramedics swooping on the hotel after a man travelling with two others reported feeling unwell.

Despite this, the 220-bedroom hotel has continued to take bookings, sparking grave fears more could be infected or come into contact with workers exposed to the deadly bug.

Tonight, after the government kept the public in the dark for hours, Staycity aparthotel finally confirmed it was at the centre of the UK's outbreak.

A hotel spokesperson said: "We have now received confirmation that two guests staying in one of our apartments in York have been tested positive for the coronavirus.

"We have been advised by Public Health England that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such our York property remains open for business."

Some rooms at the hotel have been sealed off and are being deep-cleaned today - but otherwise it's "business as usual" despite the risk posed.

Tonight some hotel guests were furious they had not been told about the coronavirus.

PhD Student Fris Ilfifi, 30, has been staying since the patients were evacuated on Wednesday, and said: “Two medics went up to his room and tested him.

"When I checked at reception they told me it was just normal flu. Guests were not wearing masks. Everything was carrying on as normal.

“I was scared then and I am scared now. It’s a hell of a lot to trust. I am trying to find somewhere else to stay and get out of here by next week.”

Another hotel guest from the North East blasted: “The hotel have told us nowt. We don’t know what’s going on."

And Andy Neale and Ellisa Imrie, both 21, from Manchester, said their trip to York “was a late Xmas present which had been ruined”.

Ellisa said: “I’m fuming. The hotel has told us nothing.

“They should be taking precautions any way so people don’t cough over each other or touch somewhere they shouldn’t.”

Health officials say they "are working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread" - amid frantic efforts to stop it spiralling out of control.

Official advice urges anyone who has come into close contact with coronavirus sufferers to "self-isolate" to prevent the infection spreading.

Director for national infection service at Public Health England Professor Sharon Peacock said: "What they'll be doing is aiming to contact everybody who has been in contact with these two cases and prevent onward transmission."
