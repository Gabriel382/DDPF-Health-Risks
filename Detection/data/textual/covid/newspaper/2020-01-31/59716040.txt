Ighalo confident of sealing loan move to Man United before deadline 
 Odion Ighalo is increasingly optimistic he can clinch a loan deal to Manchester United.

Talks over a deal are ongoing, but while the Nigerian remains in China - there’s a feeling that a deal can now be done before the deadline.

When Ighalo can fly over due to flight restrictions because of the Coronavirus outbreak remains to be seen but there’s a growing optimism that then deal is possible.

United have turned their attention to Ighalo in their increasingly frantic search for a striker after Bournemouth wanted £40million for Josh King.

United conceded defeat in their bid to land Bournemouth's King after their offer of around £20m on Thursday night was quickly rebuffed and described as 'a joke' by senior Bournemouth officials.

They followed that up by informing the Cherries they are now looking at alternatives to King rather than planning to make an improved offer.

Bournemouth were determined not lose King, 28, and United faced having to break the bank to stand any chance of persuading the Cherries to part with the former former Old Trafford academy product.

United are now focusing on other forwards on their shortlist with ex-Watford striker Ighalo, 30, now under serious consideration as the clock ticks towards Friday night's 11pm deadline.

Ighalo left the Premier League for China three years ago and has, most recently, been at Shanghai Greenland Shenhua.

The 30-year-old scored 40 goals in 100 games for Watford before signing for Shanghai Shenhua in a £22m deal.

The Nigerian enjoyed a decent season last term, scoring 10 goals in 19 games for Shanghai despite missing over two months with a hamstring problem.

United are desperate so sign a striker before the deadline with Marcus Rashford out until at least March due to a back injury and Anthony Martial struggling for consistency.
