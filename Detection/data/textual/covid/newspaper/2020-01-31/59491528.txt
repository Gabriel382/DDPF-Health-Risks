WHO declares China virus outbreak an international emergency 
 Supplied video obtained Friday, January 31, 2020, of WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom, speaking at a news conference in Geneva after the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak in China a public health emergency of international concern. "Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems," Mr Adhanom says. "In total there now 7,834 confirmed cases, including 7,736 in China. 170 people have lost their lives to this outbreak, all of them in China. We must remember that these are people, not number."
