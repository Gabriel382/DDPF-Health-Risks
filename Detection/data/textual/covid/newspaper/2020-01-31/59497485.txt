Two passengers on a Tigerair flight tested positive for coronavirus. What are airlines doing to protect passengers? 
 Tigerair is contacting hundreds of passengers from 13 different flights after two people who travelled on the same plane tested positive to coronavirus.

The airline pulled the plane from service on Thursday after Queensland Health alerted it to a positive case of coronavirus on board.

Two people with the virus are in isolation in the Gold Coast University Hospital.

The pair flew from Melbourne to Coolangatta on Tigerair flight TT566 on January 27.

Tigerair said the plane was taken out of service as a "precautionary measure" for extra cleaning.

It had flown around Australia since Monday to destinations including Cairns, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth.

The tail number of the plane is VH-VUD, a 737-800.

The man and a companion were seated in 11A and 11B.

The plane flew back to Melbourne from the Gold Coast within an hour but Tigerair's Group Medical Officer Dr Sara Souter said the risk of anyone contracting the virus is "low for passengers travelling on the aircraft in subsequent days".

Queensland's Chief Medical Officer Jeannette Young said anyone on TT566 should call 13HEALTH.

So far, there's been no change.

Airlines are talking with federal health agencies and taking advice about what steps should be taken.

Qantas said it was "operating as normal" but monitoring the situation.

Virgin Australia and Tigerair said it was business as usual.

But staff are being briefed and planes have masks on board should anyone show symptoms.
