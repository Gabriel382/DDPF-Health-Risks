Coronavirus: Two cases of deadly virus confirmed in England – Chief Medical Officer 
 The announcement comes as more than 80 Britons are on an evacuation flight from the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak were due to land in the UK. The Department of Health declined to say where in England the patients were from. However, it is understood they are not in the Wirral area, where a special facility has been set up to quarantine those returning from Wuhan.

The Chief Medical Officer has also raised the level from Low to Moderate. 
In a statement, Professor Chris Whitty, said: "We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. 
"The patients are receiving specialist NHS care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus.
"The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread.

"We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately.
"We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities."
