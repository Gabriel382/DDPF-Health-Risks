US organising flights for China evacuation 
 The US State Department says it is working with US and Chinese agencies to organise additional flights for US citizens to return to the United States from Wuhan, the epicentre of China's coronavirus outbreak.
The effort comes as major US airlines said they were suspending all flights to mainland China.
The State Department and White House did not comment on a report that the Trump administration was considering a mandatory order for all US citizens to leave the Wuhan region.
The State Department official said "as space is available, seating will be offered to US citizens on a reimbursable basis, to leave from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport to the United States. All travellers will be screened for symptoms at the airport prior to departure."
The State Department late Thursday boosted its travel advisory for China from a Level 3: Reconsider Travel to Level 4: Do Not Travel.
Chinese authorities have suspended air, road, and rail travel in the area around Wuhan and the larger Hubei Province, and placed restrictions on travel and other activities throughout the country.
