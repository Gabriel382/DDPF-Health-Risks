Inter-Korean Liaison Office Closes Amid Coronavirus Fears 
 The inter-Korean liaison office in the border city of Kaesong was closed at North Korea's request on Thursday amid coronavirus fears. The North earlier closed its border with China because it lacks any other way of dealing with a potential coronavirus outbreak.

The closure shuts the sole remaining window of communication between the two Koreas, though in reality no meetings had taken place since the second U.S.-North Korea summit broke down in Hanoi in February last year while staff from the two sides twiddled their thumbs.

Unification Ministry spokesman Lee Sang-min said that the two sides agreed to suspend operations until coronavirus fears have been completely dispelled. But he claimed they agreed "to maintain liaison through separate telephone and fax lines between Seoul and Pyongyang."

The entire South Korean staff of 17 ranking officials and 41 support personnel hastily packed up and left for Seoul on Thursday afternoon.
