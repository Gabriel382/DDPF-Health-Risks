30-year Treasury yield plumbs key 2% support level 
 Long-term Treasury yields beat a steady retreat on Thursday, pushing the rate for the 30-year Treasury bond to its lowest level since early September. The 30-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -2.48% fell 2.6 basis points to 2%, a key technical support level that if breached could presage further yield declines. The 10-year note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -4.00% fell 2.8 basis points to 1.527%. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yield. The accompanying selloff in stocks spurred haven inflows as investors looked to take shelter from the potential economic damage stemming from the coronavirus. Analysts fear that the outbreak could dent hopes for the global economy to stabilize this year.
