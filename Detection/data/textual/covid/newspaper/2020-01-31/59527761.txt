NSW testing 16 more for coronavirus 
 A three-year-old child is being tested for coronavirus as NSW authorities continue ramping up efforts to contain the deadly infection.

There have been no new confirmed NSW infections since Tuesday, although 16 people - including the toddler - have been isolated while waiting for test results.

"Since testing began 67 patients have tested negative and have been ruled out," chief health officer Kerry Chant told reporters on Friday.

NSW Health officials will speak with a virologist on Friday evening to discuss the origin of the disease, which first infected humans in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

"The thinking as of a couple of days ago was that the origin could have been bats and the virus has transitioned through another mammalian species and then acquired the ability to infect humans," Dr Chant said.

"Obviously this is subject to a lot of speculation and I'll be keen to be updated on that this evening."

Four confirmed coronavirus cases have been confirmed in NSW to date.

Two of those cases have been discharged from hospital after recovering from the infection.
