The US issued its highest level warning on Thursday advising against all travel to China as the coronavirus continues to spread.

"Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China," the State Department advisory reads, citing the fact that the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the outbreak a public health emergency.

"Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China," the statement continued.

The State Department raised the travel advisory to a level four after announcing a level three travel ban, telling US citizens to avoid nonessential travel "due to serious risks to safety and security."

The announcement follows Chinese authorities reporting over 200 deaths in the country, with over 9,700 confirmed cases of the disease worldwide.

Several other countries have advised against nonessential travel to China and the Hubei province as the virus continues to spread globally.
