Charlotte Crosby's strange reaction as she's finally told of coronavirus crisis 
 Charlotte Crosby was seen pouting and looking confused when she was finally told about the deadly coronavirus outbreak after her stint on I'm A Celebrity.

The Geordie Shore star, 29, has been isolated in South Africa for the last couple of weeks as she was filming the Australian version of the show.

Without her phone and denied access to any outside news, the campmates had no idea about the spread of the virus and the lockdown in China.

Charlotte filmed herself having a chat with her mum Leticia, who had flown in from Britain to greet her on her jungle exit.

Leticia was seen explaining the seriousness of the outbreak, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has claimed more than 200 lives.

Her daughter pouted and preened for the camera as she listened to her mum explain the grave details.

Leticia tells her: "Everyone's covered in masks - when they're checking you in [at the airport] they're covered in masks.

"It's really serious, it's getting out of hand - it' because China were eating bats... It's now spread."

Charlotte looks distracted as she asks: "Has anyone in England got it?" and her mum replies: "Yes there's been... Australia, Canada, they're shutting China down - you can't leave now.

The telly star then asks: "It's spreading that fast" the video then cut to Charlotte walking about her hotel admiring the swimming pool.

Charlotte has been in IAC isolation since January 5, meaning she was completely unaware of the growing crisis, which has now been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization.
