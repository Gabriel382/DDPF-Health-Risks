CDC quarantines Wuhan passengers in California under federal order 
 Hospital workers wearing protective eyewear and masks prepare to check blood tests taken from Indonesian students who returned from China in quarantine at a hospital in Banda Aceh on January 29, 2020.

U.S. health officials have quarantined 195 Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, taking the rare step of issuing a mandatory order to help contain the disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.

"If we take strong measures now, we may be able to blunt the impact on the United States," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

Messonnier said the CDC has 20 staff on hand to monitor their health. If any of the passengers begin to exhibit symptoms, they will be moved to a hospital, she said.

U.S. health officials confirmed Thursday the nation's first person-to-person transmission of the virus — the husband of a Chicago woman who brought the infection back from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Public health officials also said they were monitoring 21 patients in Illinois for possible infections.
