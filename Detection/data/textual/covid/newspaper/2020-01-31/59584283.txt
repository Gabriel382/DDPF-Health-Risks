Hand sanitizers, face masks as Philippine malls guard vs coronavirus 
 MANILA – Philippine mall operators said Friday it set measures to guard against a new strain of coronavirus, including free hand sanitizers within their premises.

One operator, Robinsons Malls, said it was recommending that shoppers wear face masks.

All security personnel at SM mall entrances are required to wear face masks and are instructed to urge shoppers to use alcohol dispensers at restroom doorways, the Sy group’s retail arm said.

Escalators, handrails and elevator buttons are continually disinfected while restrooms are sanitized every 30 minutes, SM said.

Megaworld Lifestyle Mall’s Southwoods Mall also deployed hand sanitizers at mall entrances to prevent the spread of disease, it said in a Facebook post.

The Philippines on Thursday confirmed its first case of the virus while the World Health Organization declared a global emergency after the death toll in China topped 200, with nearly 10,000 confirmed cases.
