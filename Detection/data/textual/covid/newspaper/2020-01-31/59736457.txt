The CDC Just Declared Coronavirus A Public Health Emergency In The US 
 A White House task force on Friday announced a nationwide public health emergency over coronavirus outbreak, triggering mandatory quarantines for US citizens traveling from the epicenter of the disease in China.
In a presidential proclamation, the task force also announced that President Trump would be barring foreign nationals traveling from China from entering the US. Relatives of US citizens would be allowed entry.
The orders will take effect on Sunday at 5 pm EST.

"It really is intended to stop the spread of this virus," CDC director Robert Redfield said at a White House briefing on the announcement. He added that the current risk of the virus for people in the US is "low".
Under the order, US travelers from Hubei Province in China would face mandatory quarantines of up to 14 days in screening centers, while travelers from elsewhere in China would be asked to self-quarantine at home.
"We still have a low risk to the American public," said NIAID director, Anthony Fauci. "But we want to keep it at a low risk."
