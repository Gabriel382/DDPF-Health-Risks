Duterte orders travel ban from Hubei 
 MANILA, Philippines—President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered the imposition of a temporary ban on Chinese nationals from China’s Hubei province, where Wuhan City — the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak— is located.

Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo confirmed the order on Friday morning, hours after the Department of Health has confirmed that a female Chinese from Wuhan is the country’s first confirmed novel coronavirus case.

The Palace official said the travel ban was issued on the recommendation of the DOH and includes “other places in China where there is a spread of the disease.”
