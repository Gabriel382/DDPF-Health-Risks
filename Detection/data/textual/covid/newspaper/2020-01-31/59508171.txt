JAKARTA/HANOI: The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe, from shops barring entry to Chinese tourists, online vitriol mocking the country’s exotic meat trade and surprise health checks on foreign workers.The virus, which originated in China, has spread to more than a dozen countries, many of them in Southeast Asia which has sensitive relations with China amid concerns about Beijing’s vast infrastructure spending and political clout in the region and sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea.But as far away as France, a newspaper has come under fire for its “Yellow Alert” headline, echoing a historic Western racist term “Yellow Peril” used to sow fear of Asian influence, while authorities and schools in Toronto, Canada, have warned against discrimination against Chinese Canadians.Chinese authorities have said the virus emerged from a market selling illegally traded wildlife, giving rise to widespread social media mocking of China’s demand for exotic delicacies and ingredients for traditional medicine. “Stop eating bats,” said one Twitter user in Thailand “Because your country is beginning (to) spread disease-...we do not accept to serve the guest from China,” read a sign outside a hotel in Vietnam . Authorities later told the hotel to remove the sign. In Myanmar, officials launched surprise health checks on Chinese workers.China’s foreign ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
