For those of you joining the coronavirus blog for the first time, let’s start by looking a look at the latest figures for deaths and infections. 

Each morning in China the National Health Commission provides updates.


The total death toll in China now stands at 213. That’s up from 170 announced at this time yesterday. That’s an increase of 25%, which is slightly down on yesterday’s increase (29%).

Confirmed cases inside China are 9,096. That’s up from the figure quoted at around this time yesterday of 7,711. It makes it an 18% rise in confirmed infections over the 24-hour period.

Between Wednesday and Thursday the rise in confirmed cases was 29% by my calculations.
