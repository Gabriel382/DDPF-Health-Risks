    The Delaware Health Dept. said they are reviewing the patient's travel history and symptoms. The patient is reportedly isolated at the hospital.
"The risk of infection from the novel Coronavirus to the average Philadelphian is very low," the Department said in a release.
Philadelphia International Airport announced Wednesday that they will be screening passengers who traveled through China. Philadelphia Airport is one of 20 airports nationwide that houses an existing CDC quarantine station.
 "The Health Department recommends that, as is normal this time of year, people wash their hands thoroughly, try not to touch their face, avoid contact with people who are sick, cover their cough or sneeze, and stay home when they are sick," the Department said.
