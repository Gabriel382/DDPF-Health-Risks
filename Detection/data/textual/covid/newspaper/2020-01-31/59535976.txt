Wuhan virus: S'pore may announce new measures in wake of WHO public health emergency declaration, says PM Lee 
 SINGAPORE - Singapore has been taking the Wuhan virus outbreak very seriously from the outset, and it is a dynamic situation which is far from over, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday (Jan 31).

He said that Singapore is watching the developments, and the latest assessment by the World Health Organisation confirms its view of the situation, with ministers evaluating what should be done next.

"And I think they'll have some announcements to make later today," he said.

He was speaking during a visit to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, the hub of the nation's virus containment.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared on Thursday (Jan 30) that the coronavirus epidemic in China now constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

There is every reason to be watchful, PM stressed, but there's also every reason to be confident.

He reminded individuals to do their part, and to be sensible.

Community spread has not occured in Singapore, it is a long way from happening, and all efforts are being made to prevent it from happening, he said.

People should come forward when they are unwell so Singapore can identify the cases and isolate them, he noted. Personal hygiene is key, and people should wash their hands frequently, and not touch their face, mouth and eyes unnecessarily because that is how germs spread into the body, he stressed.

Those who are unwell should stay at home, away from work and crowds, but for those who are well, life could go on as normal, he added.
