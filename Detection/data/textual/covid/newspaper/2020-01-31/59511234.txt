Pilots union sues American Airlines to stop U.S.-China flights due to coronavirus 
 The union that represents 15,000 American Airlines pilots has filed a lawsuit hoping to stop the company’s flights between the U.S. and China because of the threat posed by coronavirus.The Allied Pilots Association asked in Dallas County court on Thursday for American Airlines to suspend all U.S.-China flights while the CDC’s travel warning remains at Level 3 or higher, in order to avoid “exposing its members to the coronavirus, a potentially fatal, communicable disease.” The CDC issued that Level 3 warning on Jan. 27, which recommended that Americans avoid “all nonessential travel” to China.Many airlines have already suspended or severely cut their flights between the U.S. and China, and American has suspended a couple of its routes out of Los Angeles from Feb. 9 and March 27 due to “significant decline in demand.” But the lawsuit is demanding that the airline cancel its flights before that date, and also suspend its service out of Dallas. The suit notes that the average age of DFW-based captains who fly to China is 61, and that according to the CDC, “older adults are more at risk of contracting and becoming seriously ill after exposure to coronavirus.”In a statement to the Dallas Morning News, American Airlines implied that they would not be suspending flights as long as circumstances remain the same.“We are in close contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and global public health officials to make sure we are taking all necessary precautions for our customers and team members,” said the statement. “We will continue to monitor the situation and make any updates as needed.”But the union has told pilots to decline any assignments to China.“We estimate that as many as 300 passengers and crew travel to DFW alone from Chinese cities on each American Airlines flight,” said a statement from Allied Pilots Association President Eric Ferguson. “To us, that level of risk is unacceptable.”The full lawsuit is embedded below:
