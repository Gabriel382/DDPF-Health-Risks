Japan to cover passengers' 80,000-yen charter flight fee from virus-hit Wuhan: Abe 
 TOKYO -- Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Jan. 31 that the government intends to cover airfare costs Japanese nationals were initially expected to pay to be evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province due to the spread of a new coronavirus.

Speaking at a House of Representatives Budget Committee, the prime minister said, "We are mulling the idea of having the government bear the costs."

Until now the government had been planning to charge returnees a fee of 80,000 yen, which Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga referred to as a "standard economy fare." But calls have come from ruling and opposition party members asking the government to rethink the costs.
