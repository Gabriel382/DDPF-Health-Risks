Coronavirus live updates: China uses drones to police citizens for not wearing face masks 
 The Chinese government is using drones to police and harass citizens for walking outside without face masks, shows video from the English-language mouthpiece of the Communist party.

The video, posted by Global Times, shows various clips of a drone camera hovering over a person or group of people and cheekily telling them to go home and put a face mask on before coming back out in public.

“Yes, auntie, this is the drone speaking to you,” reads the caption.

The older woman looks up, seemingly puzzled at the machine flying over her.

“You shouldn’t walk about without wearing a mask,” the bodiless voice goes on. “Yes, you’d better go back home and don’t forget to wash your hands.”

She scurries away as the voice continues, “We’ve been telling people to stay at home but you still wander outside. Now a drone is watching you.”

The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency Thursday, citing worries that countries with “weak” health care systems would not be able to handle the outbreak.
