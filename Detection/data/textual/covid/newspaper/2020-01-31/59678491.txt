BREAKING: Delta to suspend flights to China Feb. 6 due to coronavirus 
 Delta Airlines is suspending all of its US flights toÂ China starting February 6, due to 'ongoing concerns' over the coronavirus.

The flight ban will last until April 30, the US carrier says.

'Between now and Feb. 5, Delta will continue to operate flights to ensure customers looking to exit China have options to do so,' Delta said in a press release on its website.

The carrier said that the 'last China-bound flight departing the US will leave on Monday, Feb. 3 with the last return flight back to the U.S. departing China on Feb. 5.'

Delta plans to 'continue to monitor the situation closely and may make additional adjustments as the situation continues to evolve.'

So far, the flu-like illness has been blamed for the deaths of more than 200 people.
