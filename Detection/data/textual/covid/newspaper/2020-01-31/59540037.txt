Australians quarantined on Christmas Island will be ‘looked after’ 
 Australians who may have been exposed to the potentially deadly coronavirus will be “well looked after” if they choose to take up the government’s offer to be quarantined on Christmas Island, according to Coalition frontbencher Ken Wyatt. Australians who are trapped in China in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak have the option of taking a chartered flight out of the country as long as they spend two weeks in quarantine on Christmas Island to ensure they do not have the potentially deadly disease. Around 600 Australians are thought to be trapped in the at-risk Hubei province. Mr Wyatt told Sky News if he was stuck in China he would be “quite happy” to be quarantined on Christmas Island, since he would be getting expert health care from experienced Australian officials.
