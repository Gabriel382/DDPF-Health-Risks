Will travel insurance cover flights canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak? 
 The outbreak and spread of the coronavirus is causing widespread disruption, with airlines worldwide suspending all flights to China.

The situation has left travelers with questions over whether they can expect insurance compensation for canceled trips.

Although many airlines have relaxed their policies, offering waivers on amendment fees or the choice to cancel for credit towards an upcoming flight, it seems most travel insurance policies simply do not account for scenarios such as this.

According to Sandberg, although some plans will provide for cancellation due to a traveler quarantine, this only applies to plans purchased before the outbreak became a "known event," which was around January 21.

However, there may be some level of trip cancellation protection available to those who happen to have purchased a Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR) optional upgrade.

"For those holding an existing travel insurance policy, they should contact their travel insurance providers to find out if their plans have any coverage," he adds.

British Airways, American Airlines, United Airlines, Air Asia, Air India, Cathay Pacific, IndiGo and Lufthansa are among the airlines who've opted to cancel flights as authorities desperately attempt to contain the virus, which causes respiratory illness.

Any travelers with impending plans to fly to China are advised to check with their airlines and look out for advisories published on the carriers' websites.
