Coronavirus outbreak: Health minister says WHO health emergency does not change Canada risk level 
 Health Minister Patty Hajdu said on Thursday that Canada was "fully in line" with recommendations from the World Health Organization, including those announced earlier in the day when WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern, and as a result there would be no change to the risk level. 



She said that there was still "no indication" that any Canadian seeking repatriation from China has the coronavirus, but said based on experience from international partners who had repatriated citizens, China has not been allowing anyone with the virus to leave possibly due to being too ill to travel and because countries are working together to prevent spread of the disease. 



Asked why they did not have a date for the plane being used to repatriate Canadians from China, Hajdu said that there were strict protocols in place mandating the need for negotiations with China in order for the plane to fly out and those were still taking place.



Hajdu also said if any people exhibited symptoms of the illness, they would be isolated as has been done with those confirmed with coronavirus in Canada. Hajdu added, quarantine would take place if a person was asymptomatic but stressed there is no evidence the disease is spread without symptoms.
