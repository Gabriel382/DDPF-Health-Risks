Duterte bans travelers from China's Hubei, coronavirus epicenter 
 MANILA- President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday ordered a ban on travelers from China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the new coronavirus outbreak, to prevent the spread of the disease, his spokesman said.

The ban could be expanded depending on "how the disease will spread in China," Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo told ANC.

Hubei in central China includes the city of Wuhan, where the pathogen is believed to have originated from. The death toll topped 200 and the number of cases approached the 10,000 mark, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque recommended the travel ban after the Philippines on Thursday confirmed its first case, a female tourist from Wuhan.

Duterte’s former longtime aide, Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go, earlier government was studying suspending travel to the Chinese province of Hubei.

The Philippines on Monday suspended the issuance of tourist visas on arrival to Chinese nationals.
