‘Hand-in-hand’: Chinese envoy lauds Filipinos’ concern amid nCov threat 
 MANILA, Philippines — Banking on the Philippines’ longstanding friendship with China, ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian on Friday said the two countries would continue to work “hand-in-hand” to overcome the challenge posed by the new coronavirus.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference, Huang expressed gratitude to the Filipinos and the Philippine government for the concern and understanding it showed towards China in light of the epidemic that struck Wuhan in Hubei province.

“We believe, China and Philippines has come through thick and thin in the past decades, or past centuries. Now we are facing the common challenge,” Huang said.

“We will continue to work hand-in-hand to overcome the difficulties and we are very confident, we will be able to bring our people back to the normal track,” he added.

Huang also gave assurance that Filipinos in China will receive the “best treatment” in the face of the 2019-nCoV threat.

He said the Chinese government is in continuous coordination with Filipino authorities to contain the virus.

“We also care about the welfare of your people in China. I know you have nationals in China and we can assure that they will have the best treatment and better care from authorities concerned,” Huang told reporters at a press conference.

According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has taken the lives of 213 people and China, with over 9,600 confirmed cases.

In the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday confirmed the first case of the virus—a Chinese woman who arrived in the country from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong on January 21 before seeking medical attention four days later due to a mild cough.

The WHO has also declared the new coronavirus outbreak as a global emergency.
