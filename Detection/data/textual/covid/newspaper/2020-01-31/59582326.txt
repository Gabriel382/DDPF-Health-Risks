Australia 'can't afford' to risk its tourism sector 
 Sky News host Peter Gleeson says Australia “simply can’t afford” to risk its tourism sector and we must ban flights to and from China. “We must accept some short term pain for longer term gain by banning flights in and out of China" Mr Gleeson said. "I can’t believe with this coronavirus so virulent, so dangerous, that I’m even saying that.” This comes after airlines in the US and UK took it upon themselves to ban direct flights in and out of Beijing and Shanghai. “As more Australian coronavirus cases are being confirmed by the hour - and the death toll mounting in China - Australia's health authorities continue to allow flights from China,” Mr Gleeson said.
