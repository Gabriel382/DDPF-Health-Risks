First priority of the federal government is to 'protect the country': Credlin 
 Sky News host Peta Credlin says she cannot believe Queensland Premier Anastacia Palaszczuk “would be put in charge of a chook raffle, let alone run a state,” as the premier criticized the federal government over its response to the coronavirus outbreak. Ms Palaszczuk claimed she was kept “in the dark” about the outbreak of coronavirus, which quickly “blew up in her face” after Health Minister Greg Hunt pointed out Queensland officials have been part of crisis meetings on a daily basis. Ms Credlin said the more the federal government is attacked for being “too strong” on border protection, the more it “highlights the sort of risk Labor continues to pose”. “The first duty of government is to protect the country,” Ms Credlin said. “We must not let short term cash considerations, or the fear of upsetting Beijing, put the safety of Australians at risk”.
