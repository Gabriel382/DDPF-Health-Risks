Coronavirus surpasses Sars epidemic, rises to 10,000 cases 
 The number of coronavirus cases has now risen to nearly 10,000 - surpassing the Sars epidemic - with Chinese officials saying the death toll now sits at 213. The Australian government is waiting for approval from China to send a Qantas jet which will transport Australians from Wuhan to a quarantine centre on Christmas Island. Nine cases have been confirmed in the country after patients tested positive in Queensland, NSW and Victoria. The Queensland Premier has criticised the federal government's handling of the outbreak - saying she hasn't been given details on all the suspected cases. The World Health Organisation has declared the outbreak a "global health emergency" after cases were reported in more than a dozen countries outside of China. Image:
