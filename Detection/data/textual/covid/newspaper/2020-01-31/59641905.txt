Operation Wuhan airlift LANDS at RAF Brize Norton 
 A jumbo jet carrying more than 100 passengers to the UK from the crisis-hit Chinese city of Wuhan has landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.

Some 83 British citizens trapped in the locked-down city at the centre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak have been flown to the UK to safety.

They were met by a fleet of at least seven hired coaches which will ferry them to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, Merseyside, where they will be isolated for two weeks.

The plane departed Wuhan at 9.45am local time today (1.45am UK time) and its passengers have endured a 12-hour flight under supervision of Army medics.

All had to have health checks before being allowed on the plane and will be constantly monitored for the next two weeks.

The UK first declared its first cases of the coronavirus earlier today and the country is now on high alert for more possible infections.
