Korea��s industrial output in Dec strongest in 3 years on revived chip activity 
 South Korea��s industrial activity in December roared back in its strongest pace in three years as investment picked up from revived demand in the semiconductor industry. 
According to Statistics Korea on Friday, the seasonally adjusted mining and manufacturing output in December rose 3.5 percent on month, bouncing back after a 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent slide in November and October, respectively. It was the strongest reading since the 4.1 percent on-month gain in November 2016.
Against a year earlier, factory output climbed 4.2 percent. 
The main Kospi was trading 0.32 percent higher at 2,154.95 as of 9:51 a.m. Friday. The Korean won fell 1.60, or 0.13 percent, against the U.S. dollar to 1,186.60. 
While output of communication and broadcasting equipment dipped 9.7 percent on month, machinery production jumped 12.6 percent led by semiconductor and display making equipment. Electric equipment output also added 8.9 percent. 
Factory operation averaged 74.3 percent, up 2.4 percentage points from the previous month. Inventory level fell 2.7 percent on month and 1.8 percent on year.
Capital investment surged 10.9 percent on month, accelerating from the 0.8 percent gain in November. Investment rose 9.1 percent in chipmaking equipment and other machinery and 15.7 percent in autos and transportation equipment, as demand for Korea��s two key export items showed signs of recovery after a months-long slump. 
Service sector output inched down 0.1 percent from the previous month. Facilities management and leasing gained 1.3 percent but wholesale and retail sectors edged down 0.7 percent. Real estate also retreated 1.9 percent following the government��s fresh set of property curbs to rein in rising home prices. 
Retail sales, a barometer of private consumption, grew 0.3 percent on month, slowed from the 3.1 percent gain in November but staying positive for the second straight month. Semi-durable goods like clothes declined 2.2 percent and non-durable like cosmetics were off 0.6 percent. But durable goods like cars and home appliances climbed 3.9 percent, driven in part by new auto launches.
For the entire 2019, industry output fell 0.7 percent, the biggest decline since the 6.4 percent drop in 1998. Factory operation averaged 72.9, the lowest since 1998 in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. 
Investment sunk 7.6 percent, falling at the fastest pace in a decade, with spending on machinery down 8.8 percent and transportation equipment 4.1 percent lower. 
Consumption was better as service output gained 1.5 percent and retail sales added 2.4 percent. 
Coincident and leading indicators in December both picked up, the first time for both indexes to turn upward since January 2017. The coincident index, which shows the state of current economic activity, rose 0.2 point on month to 99.5, snapping a four-month streak of decline. The leading index, an indicator of where the economy is headed, also gained 0.4 point to 99.6, sustaining its rise for the fourth straight month. 
The economic impact of the deadly new coronavirus from China remains to be seen. ��In the case of the SARS epidemic in 2003, the repercussions were felt in the service sector but not in manufacturing,�� said Ahn Hyung-joon, a Statistics Korea official. ��How manufacturing would be impacted by the latest virus would depend on the progression of the disease and its severity.��
