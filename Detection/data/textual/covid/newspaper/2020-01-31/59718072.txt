Coronavirus outbreak sparks powerful swings in stocks, bonds and other assets 
 A monthlong bout of coronavirus has ravished China, claiming hundreds of lives and sickening thousands but the Asian influenza also has infected the stock market and other assets, chilling bullish sentiment for the moment and stoking uncertainty at a period of lofty valuations.

Here are some of the assets and sectors that the novel coronavirus has impacted so far, since the infection was noticed Dec. 31.

Coronavirus could hurt demand for crude because China is among the biggest importers of the commodity, putting oil prices on the verge of a bear market. Entry into a bear market is defined by a price drop of at least 20% from a recent high.
