State Department Warns Against Traveling to China Amid Coronavirus Outbreak 
 The State Department on Thursday night issued an advisory telling Americans not travel to China because of the public health threat posed by the coronavirus, as world health officials grappled with the expanding footprint of the outbreak.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed the travel advisory on Twitter, saying that the department had raised its advisory for China to Level 4 — meaning do not travel there.
Mr. Pompeo cited a decision by the World Health Organization earlier Thursday to declare the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.


“Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice,” the advisory said. “Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China.”
