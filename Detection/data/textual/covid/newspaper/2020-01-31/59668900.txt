Live updates: Coronavirus deaths soar as U.S. warns against China travel 
 SEOUL — North Korea is taking all-out measures to seal itself off from the outside world as the coronavirus spreads to areas near the country’s border with China.

North Korea has not reported any case of coronavirus infection, but scores of cases have been confirmed in the Chinese provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, which border the isolated nation.

North Korea’s official party daily newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, ran a story Friday titled “A big strength to prevent the novel coronavirus.” The story cited the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, calling for a development in health care for the North Korean people. Rodong Sinmun stressed the “very important duties” of North Korean authorities “to completely block the novel coronavirus from entering our country.”

North Korea announced that air and train routes between North Korea and China are temporarily suspended as of Friday, according to travel advisories issued Thursday by the U.K. government and the Indian Embassy in North Korea. The travel advisories said all foreigners entering North Korea from China, or from Russia and having passed through China, will be quarantined for a month.

North and South Korea have agreed to temporarily shut down the joint liaison office in the border city of Kaesong in a move to fend off any further spread of the virus. Seoul’s Unification Ministry said Friday that a new hotline has been opened to carry on the liaison effort between the two Koreas.

Via the hotline, North Korea has notified the South that it has postponed plans to demolish South Korean facilities at its Mount Kumgang resort to prevent the virus spreading.
