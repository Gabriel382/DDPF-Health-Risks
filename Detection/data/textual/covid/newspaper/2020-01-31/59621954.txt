China reports 213 deaths from coronavirus; State Department warns against travel to China 
 At least 213 people have died and about 9,700 have been sickened by the novel coronavirus, according to the latest figures from China's National Health Commission. The surge in infections follows the World Health Organization's (WHO) decision Thursday to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The virus was first identified in December in Wuhan, China. Outside of China, there are 98 confirmed cases in 18 countries, including eight person-to-person transmissions in Germany, Japan, Vietnam, and the U.S., according to comments made by WHO officials on Thursday. The State Department on Friday told Americans not to travel to China.
