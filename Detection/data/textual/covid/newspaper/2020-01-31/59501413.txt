Qld demands location of Chinese travellers 
 The federal government has not told Queensland where people from China's coronavirus-stricken Hubei province are staying, the premier says.
Annastacia Palaszczuk has expressed frustration with Canberra, saying it has failed to share international flight records that would reveal the locations of Chinese travellers who might be of concern.
"We need to know where Chinese nationals are, people who have travelled from Hubei province, where they are currently located in Queensland," she told reporters in Brisbane on Friday.
Ms Palaszczuk says she has written to Prime Minister Scott Morrison to express her concerns.
"The prime minister has the data and the information of people incoming from these flights from the Hubei province," she said.
"They have the details on the incoming (passenger arrivals) card which says very clearly where they are staying and also their contact number so contract tracing is a number one priority. We do not have that information."
She said Queensland had asked for that information but it had not been provided.
"We need that information and in the first instance I believe that the federal government should be contacting these people immediately."
