 SEOUL (Reuters) - Ssangyong Motor (003620.KS) said on Friday it planned to suspend vehicle production at its plant in South Korea because of a supply disruption caused by coronavirus outbreak in China.  
The South Korean carmaker said it will idle its plant in the South Korean city of Pyeongtaek from Feb. 4 to Feb. 12, as Chinaâ€™s factory suspension had disrupted parts supplies.
