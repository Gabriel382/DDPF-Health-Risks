Facebook to remove ‘false claims or conspiracy theories’ about the coronavirus 
 Facebook is trying to keep misinformation from going viral.The tech giant’s head of health, Kang-Xing Jin, announced in a blog post Thursday that Facebook is “working to limit the spread of misinformation and harmful content” about the coronavirus outbreak.The announcement came just hours after the United Nations’ World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.Facebook said it will begin to “remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them.”The social media platform, which is also going to focus on educating people with credible information about the virus, plans to target “claims that are designed to discourage treatment or taking appropriate actions,” such as “claims related to false cures or prevention methods … or claims that create confusion about health resources that are available.”Those claims include false assertions that drinking bleach can cure the coronavirus.Instagram hashtags will also be monitored with plans in place to block or restrict hashtags “used to spread misinformation.”Facebook noted it is employing “third-party fact-checkers” for the purposes of “reviewing content and debunking false claims that are spreading related to the coronavirus.“When they rate information as false, we limit its spread on Facebook and Instagram and show people accurate information from these partners,” Jin’s post read. “We also send notifications to people who already shared or are trying to share this content to alert them that it’s been fact-checked.”Jin conceded that “not all of these steps are fully in place.“It will take some time to roll them out across our platforms and step up our enforcement methods,” he explained.In September, Facebook partnered with the WHO to combat the spread of misinformation about vaccines.At the time of publication, at least 213 people have died in the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, with over 9,700 cases confirmed in mainland China and over 140 outside mainland China, according to CNN.
