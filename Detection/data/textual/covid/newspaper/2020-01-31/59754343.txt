IOC have held crisis talks with WHO over coronavirus otubreak 
 The International Olympic Committee have held crisis talks with the World Health Organisation about the coronavirus outbreak — but plans for Tokyo 2020 remain unchanged.

Japan have 14 confirmed cases of the killer virus and have warned residents against travelling to China, where the epidemic originated.

Fears have begun to grow about how the coronavirus may affect the Olympics, which begin in Tokyo in July.

But in a statement, the IOC said: ‘Preparations for Tokyo 2020 continue as planned. It is normal practice for the IOC to collaborate with all the main UN agencies, as necessary, in the lead-up to the Games and this naturally includes the WHO.’

The Tokyo Organising Committee added: ‘We have never discussed cancelling the games. Tokyo 2020 will continue to collaborate with the IOC and relevant organisations and will review any countermeasures that may be necessary.’

Coronavirus has already affected Olympic qualifiers, with next week’s women’s basketball tournament involving Great Britain moved from China to Serbia.

A Tokyo 2020 women’s football qualifying tournament has also been relocated from China to Australia, with the Chinese team set to miss their first match against Thailand because they have been quarantined in Brisbane.
