French car parts maker PSA extending plant closures in China 
 PARIS, Jan 31 (Reuters) - French car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen said on Friday its three plants in China's Wuhan will remain closed until Feb. 14, in line with the Chinese government's guidance over the coronavirus and the extension of Lunar New Year holidays.
