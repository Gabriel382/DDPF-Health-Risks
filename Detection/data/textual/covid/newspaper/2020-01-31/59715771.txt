Trump weighs mandatory evacuation for all U.S. citizens at coronavirus epicenter in China 
 The Trump administration is planning to evacuate additional Americans next week from the region of China at the center of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, and officials are considering a mandatory order for all U.S. citizens there to leave, two officials told POLITICO.

The process is being led by the State Department and supported by HHS, which is handling the medical and other needs of evacuees.

A U.S. government flight earlier this week evacuated 195 Americans from Wuhan, China — the epicenter of the outbreak — to a military base in California. Officials are preparing for the possibility that as many as 1,000 additional Americans will need to be flown out, said one official, beginning with flights as soon as Monday. The officials also cautioned that the situation is rapidly evolving and could change. The CDC today announced it is imposing a two-week quarantine on all U.S. evacuees from Wuhan — the first such move in more than 50 years.
