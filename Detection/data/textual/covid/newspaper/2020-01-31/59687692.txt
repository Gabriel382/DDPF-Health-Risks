BOQI Medical latest to capture coronavirus money flow, up 44% 
 Chinese pharmacy operator and drug distributor BOQI International Medical (BIMI ) is, yet another, tiny outfit aiming to capture some of the tsunami of money flowing into any company even mentioning activity related to coronavirus.

In this case, the company announced that it has a "sufficient" inventory of drugs (including antivirals) and supplies (e.g., N95 masks, surgical masks, rubbing alcohol) to help meet demand during the outbreak.

BIMI, founded in 2006, was formerly known as NF Energy Saving Corp.
