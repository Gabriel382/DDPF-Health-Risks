Coronavirus now in FRANCE as doctor who treated patient struck down by bug 
 A DOCTOR in France has become the country's first person to catch coronavirus without visiting China.

He is the sixth person to have been diagnosed with the pneumonia-causing infection in France after contracting it from a patient he was treating.

The doctor's case makes France the second European country – and the fourth globally – to have patients who did not catch the killer bug in China.

Germany, Vietnam and Japan have all also seen the virus pass between humans on their own soil.

And this is worrying health authorities and governments around the world.

Last night the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak a global health emergency and today two cases were confirmed in the United Kingdom.

Meanwhile an exodus is under way from the epicentre of the outbreak, the Chinese city of Wuhan.

Numerous countries are carrying out or planning evacuation flights as many airlines cancel flights from China.

About 110 British and European citizens are being flown back to a military base in Oxfordshire where they will be kept in quarantine.

The death toll in Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the epidemic, had risen to 204 and there were 9,692 cases of infection nationally.

About 100 cases have been reported in at least 18 other countries, with no deaths outside China.

Even as the WHO said cases had spread to 18 countries, Italy announced its first confirmed cases, in two Chinese tourists.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the government had decided to close all air traffic between Italy and China.

The virus is believed to have originated in a food market illegally selling wildlife in Wuhan. About 60 million people in Hubei province are living under virtual lockdown.

With new cases being reported around the world, anti-China sentiment is emerging in some places and manufacturers are scrambling to meet demand for protective masks.
