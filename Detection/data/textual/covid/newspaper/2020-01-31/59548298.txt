This is coming after the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus, the deadly flu-like virus which was first noticed in Chinese city of Wuhan as a world health emergency.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the reason for declaration of the virus as a world health emergency is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries. The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems.
