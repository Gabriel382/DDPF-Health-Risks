Palaszczuk demands location of Chinese travellers 
 January 31, 2019. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk speaks to reporters in Brisbane, accusing the federal government of not handing over details of where travellers from China's coronavirus-stricken region are staying. "The prime minister has the data and the information of people incoming from these flights, from the Hubei province, they have the details on the incoming card, which says very clearly, where they are staying and also their contact number. So contact tracing is the number one priority... we need that information," Ms Palaszczuk says. "Secondly, we know now that a lot of cases are coming from outside Hubei province in China itself. So we must know where else these people are staying in Queensland and Australia," Mr Palaszczuk says. (AAP Video/Sonia Kolbacher)
