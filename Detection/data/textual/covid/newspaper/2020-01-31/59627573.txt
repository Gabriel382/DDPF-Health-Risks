Levi Strauss hits headwinds in China 
 Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) says it has closed about half of its stores in China due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus.

"While this will put a damper on our growth in China in the near-term, we are continuing to execute on our strategies there," stated CEO Charles Bergh on the post-earnings conference call.

Bergh also noted that unrest in Hong Kong cost the company some growth in the back half of last year.
