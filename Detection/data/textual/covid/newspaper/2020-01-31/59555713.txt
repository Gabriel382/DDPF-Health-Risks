Flights out of China continue to arrive because Australia is 'motivated by the dollar' 
 Sky News host Jane Marwick says she “would like to see as many precautions taken as necessary” when it comes to dealing with the deadly coronavirus. There is debate surrounding a potential decision from the federal government to shut down all flights arriving from China into Australia. “I don’t blame people for being concerned” Ms Marwick told Sky News host Peta Credlin and said if coronavirus was more deadly, then Australia would "have been too slow to act”. Ms Marwick said The “crux of the problem” is “two-fold” and Australia is “motivated by the dollar and not offending China”. Image: Getty
