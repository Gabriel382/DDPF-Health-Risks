"The American public can be assured the full weight of the US government is working to safeguard the health and safety of the American people," Azar said.The US will also funnel flights from China through just seven airports: New York's JFK, Atlanta, Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago.US airlines have all suspended service to China amid plummeting demand due to the coronavirus. However, Chinese airlines are continuing to fly to the US, and connections through other countries in Asia remain an option for travelers between American and Chinese cities.The city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus is believed to have originated, and the larger Hubei province have been quarantined by Chinese officials since earlier this month.



Travel between China and the US has dropped significantly since the Hubei quarantine began."Since the Chinese have locked down the Hubei province, travel from China to the US as of yesterday had dropped by close to 12%," Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of the US Citizenship and Immigration Service, said during the briefing. "Travel from US to China had dropped by well more than 50%."US health officials began screening arriving passengers at several airports in January.Chinese health officials say the incubation period for the virus ranges from 1 to 14 days, during which time carriers can be infectious, even if they don't show any symptoms.Â The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed a test for the virus, but the agency's director, Robert Redfield, said it was not fully reliable."We've seen people who had a detectable virus, then they didn't have a detectable virus, and then three days later they had a detectable virus," Redfield said. "We don't know the natural history of how this virus is secreted."



Redfield said that he expected cases to appear in the US despite the travel ban."We are going to see additional cases in this country," he said. "In the six cases we defined, a number of them came in asymptomatic."Earlier on Friday, the CDC issued a mandatory quarantine order to nearly 200 Americans who were evacuated from China this week. It was the first CDC quarantine in more than 50 years.The coronavirus has sickened nearly 10,000 people and killed at least 213. It has spread to at least 22 countries, including the United States.
