The new cases in China bring the global total to more than 10,000 cases with at least 213 deaths. England's chief medical officer  also  confirmed the first two cases of the coronavirus in the UK, less than 24 hours after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global emergency.

The move, which effectively shuts out the island's largest group of visitors, takes effect Saturday. It is the first Southeast Asian country to implement a travel ban to Chinese travelers to contain the outbreak. The announcement comes after t he U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory on Thursday for China from Level 3 to Level 4, citing the coronavirus outbreak in that country. The State Department only flags a handful of countries as Level 4, its highest warning "due to a greater likelihood of life-threatening risks."
