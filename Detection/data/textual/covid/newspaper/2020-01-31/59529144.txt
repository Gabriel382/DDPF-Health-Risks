31 people probed for suspected novel coronavirus: DOH 
 MANILA - Authorities are monitoring 31 people for possible novel coronavirus infection, the Department of Health said Friday.

The tally includes a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- who earlier tested positive for the pathogen, said DOH Spokesperson and Undersecretary Eric Domingo.

In China, there were 9,692 cases of infection and the death toll rose to more than 200 as of early Friday, Chinese health authorities said.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Thursday a global health emergency as the virus spread at least 18 other countries.

The move will trigger tighter containment and information-sharing guidelines to all countries, but may disappoint Beijing, which had expressed confidence it can beat the "devil" virus.
