CEE MARKETS-Stocks recover slightly; coronavirus fears persist 
 By Joanna Plucinska WARSAW, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Central Europe's stock markets recovered slightly on Friday after falling sharply this week as investors assessed the economic impact of a fast-spreading viral outbreak in China that has killed 213 people so far. The World Health Organization declared on Thursday that the coronavirus epidemic in China now constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. Emerging stocks fell for the seventh straight session. All markets have struggled this week as the virus has spread, but stocks have been hardest hit. Prague's index recovered by 0.74% from a seven-week low hit in the previous session, while Budapest was up 0.27% after hitting an eight-week low on Thursday. Czech-based anti-virus software maker Avast rebounded after losing a quarter of its value in the past few days over a data privacy scandal. The firm said on Thursday it would close its Jumpshot business to alleviate concerns. Its stock was up 6.6% in Prague, and helped boost the Prague stock exchange . Warsaw's index, however, fell 0.67% as Poland's biggest oil refiner Orlen continued to slide after weaker-than-expected Q4 results on Thursday, analysts said. Markets weren't affected by the fact that it is the UK's last day in the European Union, putting an end to more than three years of political uncertainties across the region. Economic relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union will be negotiated over the course of the next year. Analysts said there would still be economic uncertainty related to the negotiations, but that it would be less intense than before the Brexit day and turbulence is likely to be expected only in the coming months as negotiations go on. Currencies in the region remained close to their recent lows after drops this week. The Czech crown edged up 0.05% to 25.24 to the euro, while the Hungarian forint rose 0.20% to 336.54 to the euro. The Polish zloty, however, dropped 0.26%.
