US Declares Public Health Emergency, Travelers Returning From Hubei To Be Quarantined 
 Anyone who expected Trump's task force to give algos the all clear to BTFD, will be disappointed because moments ago Trump's coronavirus tzar, Azar said the US is declaring a public health emergency, US citizens returning from Hubei will be quarantined for 14 days and all flights coming from China will be funneled to 7 airports:

That was the bad news, which is certain to infuriate China which spent all that money bribing the WHO for nothing. There was also some good news.

The algos, realizing this is their cue to ramp it, are doing the best, but the Dow remains about 600 points lower, about 50 points off the lows.

At 3:30pm on Friday, so strategically 30 minutes before the market close, Donald Trump's coronavirus task force is holding a public briefing on the latest pandemic developments.

Will they give the "all clear" as Trump tried last week in an attempt to ramp stocks for a green close? Watch and find out.
