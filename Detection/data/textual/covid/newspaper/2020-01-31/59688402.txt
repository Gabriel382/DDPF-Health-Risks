Aust govt poised for Wuhan evacuation 
 WHO has declared a global emergency as Australia readies quarantine facilities on Christmas Island

A Qantas passenger plane is poised to evacuate Australians stranded at the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak as soon as Chinese officials approve the plan.

The government anticipates China will approve the evacuation over the weekend, meaning stranded Australians could leave Wuhan in the early hours of Monday morning.

Evacuees will be flown back to Australia first before being taken to Christmas Island in smaller aircraft.

Medical specialists will meanwhile spend the weekend preparing quarantine facilities for the arrival of evacuees.

Experts from Australia's disaster response team were dispatched to the island on Friday.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has been forced to defend plans to make Australians pay some of the costs of the evacuation.

He said costs had been applied to evacuees in the past, noting that not all the 600 or so Australians who had registered for the airlift would be evacuated.

The World Health Organisation has declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency but says containment is still possible.

The declaration means there will be a greater focus on a global response, with WHO fearful of what could happen if the virus reaches countries ill-prepared to cope with high infection rates.

"Australia has been acting in advance of this decision," Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.

China has almost 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 200 people have died.

The virus has spread to 18 countries including Australia.
