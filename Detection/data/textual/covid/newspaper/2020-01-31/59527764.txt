Copper poised for biggest monthly fall since May on virus fears 
 SINGAPORE, Jan 31 (Reuters) - London copper prices rose on Friday, but were on track for their biggest monthly decline in eight months as the coronavirus epidemic raised fears of a slowdown in demand from top metals consumer China.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) has fallen 8.9% so far in the month, on course for its sharpest drop since May 2019.

The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the virus outbreak a global health emergency, with the death toll in China reaching 213 on Friday and the number of confirmed cases rising to 9,692.

London copper, often used as a gauge of economic health, has lost some 10% since the virus started making headlines last week. However, it rose 0.6% to $5,623.50 a tonne by 0515 GMT on Friday after 12 straight sessions of losses.

China is the world's biggest copper consumer and a major user of many other metals. Fears that the epidemic would stall economic activities have dented metals demand.
