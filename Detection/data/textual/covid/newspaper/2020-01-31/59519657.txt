The Wuhan Coronavirus to affect the Galaxy S20 accessories supply chain 
 It seems that the widespread Wuhan Coronavirus will affect a number of supply chains, including the one for the Samsung Galaxy S20 lineup's accessories. So customers seeking accessories such as cases and screen protectors at launch won't find anything for their brand new phones.




MobileFun received a number of letters from manufacturers that there would be shipping delays due to the Coronavirus outbreak and the extended Chinese New Year holidays. The government officially extended the holiday season as a way to battle the spread of infection so a lot of factories have already suspended operations and will stay out of business for a while.


Additionally, goods traveling to western markets would go through stricter control and delaying the shipment process even further. So if are able to get your hands on a Galaxy S20 accessories early on, you would be one of the lucky buyers.
