Carrasco re-joins Atletco Madrid on loan until the end of the season 
 A familiar face has returned to Atletico Madrid in the shape of Yannick Carrasco - after he re-joined the club on loan until the end of the season.

Carrasco has spent two-and-a-half seasons in the Spanish capital before leaving for the Dalian Yifang and lures of the wealthy Chinese Super League in February 2018.

However, the 26-year-old has returned to Atletico on a temporary basis with the start of Chinese Super League indefinitely suspended due to the Coronavirus outbreak.
