Happy Friday everyone! Etsy has met an important diversity goal, the racist response to the coronavirus, a building at Berkeley gets a new name, and a hate-spewing robocaller gets a big phone bill. 



But first, here’s your breaking (dinosaur) news, in Haiku.



Fenn, who is nearlyfour, wrote her first song. It isabout dinosaurs.



Her dad put it onthe internet and it madeeveryone happy.



The dinosaurs don’tsurvive, in the song or reallife. But Fenn found a



way to make the lifethey did have seem beautiful.It’s a “big bang” world



says Fenn. Make sure youfall in love. And make sure youalways say good-bye.



Have a love-and-party-filled weekend.
