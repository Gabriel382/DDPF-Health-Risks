Evacuate our citizens 
 It is extremely urgent to bring home our children who are studying in Wuhan and other places in China to protect them from the deadly Coronavirus. Our government should charter aircraft and start this work immediately. It seems from various news reports that no effort has been made so far to bring back our citizens even though many other countries have already done so.
