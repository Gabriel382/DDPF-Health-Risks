Wyndham Clark shoots 10-under 61 to lead Phoenix Open by 2 
 Wyndham Clark beat darkness — and everyone else Thursday at TPC Scottsdale.


    
            Playing in the second-to-last group off the 10th tee, Clark shot a career-best 10-under-par 61 to take the first-round lead in the Phoenix Open.


    
            He had eight birdies in a 10-hole stretch from No. 12 to No. 3, added two more on Nos. 7 and 8 and putted out for par on No. 9 just after sunset. “I hit a lot of fairways and I just gave myself a lot of looks and the putter was hot,” Clark said.


    
            The 26-year-old University of Oregon alum is in his second full season on the tour. He missed the cuts the past two weeks.


    
            Billy Horschel was second, holing nearly 200 feet of putts in an afternoon 63. J.B. Holmes was another stroke back after a roller-coaster start — highlighted by a hole-in-one — and big finish in the morning wave. He won the event in 2006 and 2008 for his first PGA Tour titles.


    
                                
            
                                

            
            Tom Hoge, Harris English, Bud Cauley and Byeong Hun An shot 65, and Nate Lashley, K.J. Choi, Sungjae Im, Adam Long and Hudson Swafford were at 66.


    
            Jon Rahm opened with a 67. He can jump from No. 3 to No. 1 in the world with a victory, provided top-ranked Brooks Koepka — tied for 48th in the Saudi International after an opening 70 — finishes out of the top four.

            Defending champion Rickie Fowler had seven bogeys in a 74. Jordan Spieth also shot 74. Bubba Watson, playing alongside Spieth, bogeyed two of his last three for a 69.


    
            European Tour: Graeme McDowell and Gavin Green shared the lead at the Saudi International by shooting 6-under 64 in the first round at King Abdullah Economic City.


    
                                
            
            McDowell, the 2010 U.S. Open champion at Pebble Beach, birdied the final three holes despite strong afternoon winds sweeping the course next to the Red Sea. Five players were one shot behind at 5-under, including 2016 British Open champion Henrik Stenson.


    
                                            
                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                

                    
            Phil Mickelson, McDowell’s playing partner, shot a 66 and trailed by two shots, alongside five others. Defending champion Dustin Johnson, who won the inaugural event last year, carded a 67 to be in a group of seven at 3-under. Koepka and former No. 1 Lee Westwood both shot 70.


    
            Saudi Arabia’s controversial image and human-rights record affected the lineup at the Royal Greens Golf  Country Club. Rory McIlroy said last month that the country’s image was as a factor in declining his invitation, and a reported $2.5 million appearance fee.


    
                                

            
            Mickelson said last month on Twitter he understood those fans “who are upset or disappointed” about his decision to play there instead of at the  Phoenix Open with its large crowds.


    
            PGA Tour Champions: Stephen Ames shot a 9-under 63 to take a four-stroke lead over a Hall of Fame quartet in the Morocco Champions in Marrakech, the first PGA Tour Champions event in Africa.


    
            Bernhard Langer, Colin Montgomerie, Jose Maria Olazabal and Retief Goosen shot 67 in sunny conditions with an afternoon high of 77 degrees.


    
            LPGA cancels China event: The LPGA says it has canceled the Blue Bay LPGA event scheduled for the first week of March on Hainan Island in China, citing health concerns and travel restrictions because of  the coronavirus outbreak.


    
            China has reported more than 7,700 cases of the virus and 170 deaths. The industrial hub of Wuhan and other Chinese cities are on lockdown.
