British man and his family miss evacuation flight from Wuhan 
 A British man has said his family missed an evacuation flight to the UK from coronavirus-hit Wuhan because they could not get to the airport in time.

Adam Bridgeman told the BBC’s Today programme on Friday that he, his wife and one-month-old son had been unable to find a car to the airport in time to catch the flight.

After several delays, the flight – chartered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) – left Wuhan at 9.45am local time on Friday, carrying 83 Britons and 27 non-UK nationals, mostly from EU countries.

But Bridgeman said even though the FCO had sent a car, it had arrived too late to get him, his Chinese wife and newborn son to the airport on time. He said his wife had even tried calling the police to see if they could help.

He added: “I got a call saying there would be a flight leaving at 5am but we had to be at the airport at 1am. We thought we are probably not going to make it, we won’t go, because going to the airport, getting on a plane with our newborn son is in itself a kind of a risk.

“Then we got another call, they said they had delayed the flight a little bit. At this point we thought maybe we should go. We tried to get transport to the airport, unfortunately we were unable to find a car. She [his wife] phone the police to see if they could arranging something, but nothing.

“Fortunately in the end the Foreign Office arranged for a car to come pick us up. But unfortunately by the time he arrived – because we had some trouble getting him to get to the right spot to pick us up – by the time he was there, we only had about 15 minutes to get to the airport, so we thought ‘it’s too late’ so we just went home.”

Bridgeman said the FCO had told him that his family might be able to leave the city on another flight.

He added: “The Foreign Office said that they might be able to organise for us to board a different plane from, in their words, one of Britain’s EU partners.”
