Snooker's China Open postponed in wake of deadly coronavirus crisis as first UK victims emerge 
 SNOOKER’S China Open has been postponed in light of the ongoing coronavirus crisis.

The lucrative 64-man event, which carries a £1m prize fund, was set to take place between March 30 and April 5 in Beijing.

Some airlines, including British Airways, have cancelled all flights to mainland China.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have advised British citizens “against all but essential travel” to the country.

The death toll has risen to 170 people and there have been more than 7,700 cases recorded worldwide.

There are plans to stage it later in the season if the situation improves but the season-ending World Snooker Championships take place at the Crucible from April 18.

China is a massive market for the sport with several stars in the world rankings.

A World Snooker Tour statement said: “Considering the current health and travel situation in China our highest priority has to be the welfare of our players, staff and the many fans who travel around China and beyond.

“Discussions with our partners in terms of staging this event at a later date are ongoing.

“In the meantime, our thoughts are with all of our many friends across China and in particular those affected by the coronavirus.”

In the UK a desperate hunt was underway today to find everyone who had contact with Britain's first coronavirus victims after two members of the same family fell ill at a Yorkshire hotel.
