GROUNDED Coronavirus spurs Delta Air Lines to stop all US-China flights for three months 
 DELTA Air Lines is set to halt all US-China flights for three months, as the deadly coronavirus continues to spread worldwide.

The flights will cease on Feb. 6 and the stop lasts through April 30,Â  Delta announced.

The major carrier, however, will continue operations until Feb. 6 to "ensure customers looking to exit China have options to do so."

Delta stated: "The last China-bound flight departing the U.S. will leave on Monday, Feb. 3 with the last return flight back to the U.S. departing China on Feb. 5."

The airline said it will continue to monitor the situation and could make adjustments.
