Spain confirms first case of coronavirus - Health Ministry 
 MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Spain's National Centre for Microbiology has confirmed the country's first case of coronavirus after a man was diagnosed with the virus on the remote island of La Gomera in the Canaries, the Health Ministry said late on Friday.

The patient is part of a group of five people taken into observation on the island and isolated after it was found they had come into contact with a German man diagnosed with the virus. (Reporting by Nathan Allen; Editing by Sandra Maler)
