Coronavirus Infection and Death Rates Surpass SARS, WHO Declares Emergency 
 Today the W.H.O. Declares Global Emergency, something any rational person knew at least a week ago.

Declaring a global emergency would allow the WHO to coordinate government responses to the crisis.

As the WHO finally declares an emergency, First U.S. Case of Person-to-Person Transmission Confirmed, 195 U.S. citizens in isolation.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that it has confirmed the first U.S. case of person-to-person spread of coronavirus, among a married couple in Illinois. There are now six confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S., two of which are in Chicago. The sixth case is the husband of the first confirmed case in Illinois, a woman in her 60s. He did not travel to Wuhan, China, the city that first identified the novel coronavirus, and only recently began to show symptoms of the virus. The first U.S. residents to be diagnosed with the coronavirus had all recently traveled to Wuhan City, China. There are now 21 people under investigation in Illinois and a total of 165 under investigation in the U.S., according to the CDC.

Jim Bianco has another set of excellent charts. These are from an email exchange today.

In case you were wondering what the Wuhan meat market looked like before it was closed, here you go, but this may be disturbing.
