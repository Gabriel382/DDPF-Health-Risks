Goldman Sachs says virus outbreak to hit US and China growth 
 The coronavirus outbreak is likely to hit China's economic growth by 0.4 percentage point in 2020 and will potentially drag the U.S. economy lower as well, due to lower tourism and exports, investment bank Goldman Sachs said on Friday.

The bank estimates a 0.4 percentage-point hit to the U.S. economy in the first quarter, but said growth would likely rebound in the following quarter "leaving only a small net drag on U.S. full-year 2020 growth".

Goldman Sachs revised down China's 2020 GDP growth expectations to 5.5% from 5.9%.
