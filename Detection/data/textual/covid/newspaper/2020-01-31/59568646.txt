(Reuters) - Londonâ€™s FTSE 100 slipped lower on Friday as coronavirus fears intensified and as a firmer pound dragged exporter shares lower, while Aston Martin drove the midcaps higher, hours before Britain leaves the European Union. 
The main index .FTSE gave up 0.2%, as exporters such as HSBC (HSBA.L) and Diageo (DGE.L) fell. Risk sentiment was also hit after the World Health Organisation declared a global emergency over the spread of the newly-found virus. 
The FTSE 250 .FTMC recorded a 0.5% gain, with Aston Martin (AML.L) surging 25% after Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll said he would take a stake in the luxury carmaker. 
Senior Plc (SNR.L), a supplier to Boeing (BA.N), underperformed the midcap index and slid 5.5% after warning revenue and margins at its aerospace division would decline in 2020 due to the 737 MAX jet grounding.
