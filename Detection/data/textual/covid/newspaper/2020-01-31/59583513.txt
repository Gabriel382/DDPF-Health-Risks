Australia's largest university postpones classes for a fortnight over coronavirus 
 Melbourne's Monash University is delaying the start to on-campus classes for a fortnight amid concerns over the international coronavirus outbreak.

Classes were scheduled to commence on March 2, however, in a statement the university said physical on-campus teaching would not commence until March 16. Online classes will commence on March 9.

Monash is Australia's largest university with more than 80,000 students.

"The novel coronavirus has created an unprecedented situation where some of our community of students and staff will not make it back in time from affected areas or isolation in time for the commencement of semester 1, 2020," a statement on the Monash website said.

Three cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Victoria, two in Queensland and four in NSW.

National and state health authorities recommend that anyone who has travelled in China's Hubei province self-isolate for 14 days after leaving the province.

People who have recently travelled to other parts of China or other countries are not being asked to self-isolate.

Monash Student Association president James McDonald said that while the association recognised the challenges of the coronavirus, they were concerned about the lack of student consultation.

The students are also worried that the period between when classes ended and exams were to begin was to be reduced from nine to five days and about the postponement of orientation week.

"The MSA supports action which is motivated by concern for student health and safety," Mr McDonald said.

"This response from the university is unprecedented.

"We now expect the university to take similarly unprecedented action to preserve student experience and educational outcomes."
