TSX falls amid concerns about economic impact from spreading virus; loonie down 
 TORONTO -- Canada's main stock market fell amid concerns that a spreading coronavirus could hamper the world economy and demand for crude oil.

"There are concerns starting to emerge that this might have an impact on economic growth, certainly in China but perhaps beyond that," said Kevin McLachlan, portfolio manager at Fiduciary Trust Canada.

China is now so linked to the global supply chain that even North American companies may see an impact if there's a slowdown in Chinese factories or supply chains, he said.

One forecaster predicted that China's GDP rate could drop to 4.5 per cent in the first quarter, down from six per cent, McLachlan said.

Meanwhile, the U.S. GDP rate is already slow, slipping to 2.1 per cent on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter and hitting its slowest pace in three years in 2019. Consumer spending decelerated to 1.8 per cent, the weakest since the first quarter of 2019.

The coronavirus is not going to help market sentiment, he said, noting that up to 70 per cent of the U.S. economy is dependent on consumer spending.

"If that starts to pull back in the U.S. that could have a significant effect on U.S. GDP," he said in interview.

The virus hit a key threshold Thursday as the infection of more than 8,100 people globally surpassed the total reached during the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003.

On top of that, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus.

The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the new virus to more than a dozen countries as a global emergency Thursday after the number of cases spiked more than tenfold in a week. China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths.

However, the declaration didn't cause the market selloff, said McLachlan, noting that markets fell in the morning before the declaration was made.
