Adamson orders Chinese students to quarantine themselves, amid nCoV threat 
 MANILAâ€”Adamson University announced that it is requiring its Chinese students to quarantine themselves beginning Friday, January 31, amid fears of a possible outbreak of the new coronavirus in the Philippines.

The directive, posted on Facebook by the Adamson student council, will be in effect until Feb. 14.

Chinese citizens were also advised to hold off conducting transactions with the university.

Other students, meanwhile, will continue with their classes.

The announcement came a day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the Philippines' first case of the new coronavirus, a 38-year-old woman from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus originated.

The death toll in China from the new coronavirus reached more than 200 on Friday, with overall cases worldwide rising rapidly in an outbreak that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.
