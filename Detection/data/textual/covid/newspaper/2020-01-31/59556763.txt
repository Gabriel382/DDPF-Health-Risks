Hitachi April-Dec. net profit down 33% on weak overseas sales 
 TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Hitachi Ltd. reported Friday its group net profit for the April to December period fell 33.3 percent from a year earlier to 55.15 billion yen ($505 million), dragged down by sales falls in China and other Asian countries.

The industrial machinery and electronic device manufacturer also said its operating profit fell 16.6 percent to 445.63 billion yen on sales of 6.34 trillion yen, down 6.5 percent.

Other Asian nations are the largest market for Hitachi outside Japan comprising 21 percent of total sales, with around half coming from China. In the world's second-largest economy, revenues fell 10 percent to 707.9 billion yen in the reported months.

Chief Financial Officer Mitsuaki Nishiyama said at a press conference the recent outbreak of the new coronavirus has "made it even more difficult" to forecast the outlook for the global economy, including China.

"We need to closely watch the situation such as the extent of the spread of the virus and its impact on global supply chains. But in any case, we can't expect a big recovery in macroeconomics," he said.

Hitachi said falls in sales in the energy and automotive systems sectors failed to make up for a boost in revenues from information technology services and industry-use equipment such as air conditioners.

Hitachi maintained its net profit forecast for the fiscal year to March at 170 billion yen after booking a one-time expense of 378 billion yen for a settlement with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. over losses from a thermal power generation project in South Africa involving their joint venture.

It lowered its operating profit projection to 669 billion yen from 685 billion yen but kept its sales outlook at 8.70 trillion yen.
