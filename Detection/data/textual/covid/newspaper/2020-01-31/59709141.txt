 Amaravati: AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rescue the Telugu youth who were trapped in Wuhan city of China, where the deadly Coronavirus has been killing hundreds of people within days. He wrote the letter to PM on Friday late night.
 
 
The chief minister's letter as it is, 'It is to bring to your kind notice that 35 youth from Andhra Pradesh are trapped in the locked-down city of Wuhan in China amid the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus. They are part of a group of staff of Panel Optodisplay Technology Private Ltd. (POPTL) who went there for training in August 2019. 
 
 
Chinese company POTPL selected 35 students from Visakhapatnam in 2019 during campus placements, to work at its upcoming LCD TV screen manufacturing unit near Tirupati. Later, they, along with others, were sent to Wuhan for training. The batch was to return to India in the first week of March this year. 
 
 
The parents of the affected employees are worried and want their wards back home at the earliest. Therefore, I request you to direct the concerned in Indian Embassy in China to evacuate them to India at the earliest and provide all necessary assistance.'
