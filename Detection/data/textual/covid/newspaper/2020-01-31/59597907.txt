Coronavirus: Cruisers disembark but as European cases on the rise 
 On Thursday, Italian authorities kept more 7.000 people trapped aboard a cruise ship moored in the Italian port of Civitavecchia, close to Rome.  
The suspicion that a couple of Chinese tourists were carrying the new coronavirus set off the alarm. But after they tested negative, all passengers and crew were authorised to disembark.

Flights suspended
Dozens of airlines have suspended connections with mainland China, among them the European big four: British Airways, Iberia, Air France, and KLM.
France, Portugal and the UK have sent planes to the affected zone in China to evacuate hundreds of European nationals.

The mortality rate of the new coronavirus is lower than SARS but it is also more contagious.
