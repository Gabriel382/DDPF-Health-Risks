Gold notches gains for the day and week as fear of spread of coronavirus hurts 
 Gold prices finish higher on Friday, ending at the highest settlement in about three weeks as a viral outbreak originating out of China continued to grow. February gold GCG20, +0.52% closed $6.50, or 0.4%, higher at $1,571.90 an ounce on Comex. The metal also marked a weekly gain of 0.4%. China has moved to restrict movement of some 46 million people in and out of cities near the center of the outbreak, while also canceling Lunar New Year events as the number of infections continued to rise. The virus also continued to spread to other countries. Friday's settlement marks gold's highest since Jan.7, according to FactSet data.
