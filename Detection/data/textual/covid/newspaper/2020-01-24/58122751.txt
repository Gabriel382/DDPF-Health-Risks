Goldman Sachs estimates that the bushfires could level a -0.4% hit to GDP in the "near-term," analyst Matthew Ross wrote in a January 23 research note. On top of that, markets are also concerned about the impact the coronavirus could have on China's growth — in research notes, analysts at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America said they saw risk-off sentiment define Asian markets Friday. China is Australia's top trading partner, according to a 2019 government report, leaving the country exposed to dips in activity that result from the Wuhan virus.
