 NEWS RELEASE

REGION OF WATERLOO

*************************

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is actively monitoring the 2019 Novel Coronavirus and is in close contact with the World Health Organization and provinces to assess the situation and any potential risk to Canadians. At this time PHAC has assessed the risk as low for Canada and for Canadian travellers.


There have been no confirmed cases identified in Canada at this time. As with other viruses of this nature, transmission is thought to occur via respiratory droplets.


Symptoms include:



	Fever

	Cough

	Difficulty breathing




If you have travelled to Wuhan, China within 14 days and develop symptoms, avoid contact with others and contact your health care provider. Call ahead to allow health care staff to manage your case appropriately. Based on emerging information, reports suggest that there has been limited person to person spread of 2019 Novel Coronavirus.


However, as a reminder, Public Health always recommends everyday steps to help prevent the spread of germs and viruses:



	Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

	Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

	Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

	Stay home when you are sick.

	Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

	Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
