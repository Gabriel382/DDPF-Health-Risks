Coronavirus reaches Europe with two cases confirmed in France 
 Two cases of the coronavirus were confirmed in France on Friday — the first cases in Europe.

Both patients had traveled to China, the epicenter of the deadly outbreak that’s cropped up in a half-dozen other countries, leaving at least 26 people dead.

“We have two cases,” said France’s Health Minister Agnes Buzyn. “We will probably have other cases.”

One of the people sickened is a 48-year-old man who passed through Wuhan — where the coronavirus originated — before traveling to France on Wednesday. He is hospitalized in the southwestern city of Bordeaux, while the second person is hospitalized in Paris.

Buzyn said the second person also traveled to China but she had little other information on their case.

The minister said France is the first European country to have confirmed coronavirus cases partly because it’s developed a test allowing medics to rapidly diagnose the illness.
