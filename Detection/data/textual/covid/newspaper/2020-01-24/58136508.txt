 Health officials confirmed a second U.S. case of a coronavirus as China locked down more cities near the epicenter of the outbreak Friday.
 An unidentified patient in Illinois has the respiratory illness, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Friday. The Chicago woman in her 60s came home from a trip in Wuhan, China, on Jan. 13.
 
    “Based on what we know right now, the immediate risk to America remains low,” CDC Director Robert Redfield tweeted Friday.
  Meanwhile, Chinese authorities are restricting travel in 12 cities, The New York Times reported. Around 35 million people are under travel restrictions ahead of Saturday’s Lunar New Year. (RELATED: Airports Around The World Ramp Up Health Checks As Coronavirus Death Toll Rises To 6)
