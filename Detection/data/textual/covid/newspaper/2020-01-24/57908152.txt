Japan confirms 2nd new-coronavirus infection 
 TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan's health ministry said Friday it has confirmed a second infection with a new deadly virus that has been rapidly spreading from the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

The patient is a man in his 40s from the city, who is on a trip to Japan, the ministry said, adding that he has been hospitalized in Tokyo.

The man arrived in Japan last Sunday after contracting a fever five days before, according to the ministry.

His symptoms had eased by the time he arrived in Japan, having visited hospital twice in China on Jan. 15 and Jan. 17.

But the traveler then went to hospital in Japan on Monday, although he was not diagnosed with pneumonia, the ministry said.

But as the man continued to have a fever and a sore throat, he went to hospital again on Wednesday and was diagnosed with pneumonia, it said.

The man was later transferred to a Tokyo hospital and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases confirmed that he had tested positive for the virus, which has killed at least 18 in China and infected more than 600 globally.
