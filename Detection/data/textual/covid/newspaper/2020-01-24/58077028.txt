U.S. health officials said they diagnosed a second patient with the China coronavirus after a Chicago woman returned from Wuhan with the infection, and they are currently monitoring 63 other potential cases here.

The cases currently being monitored in the U.S. stretch across 22 different states, including the first patient in Washington state and the new case in Illinois, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday.

Officials said the patient, a woman in her 60s, is currently doing well and is in stable condition.

"CDC believes the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low at this time, but the situation is evolving rapidly," she said.

The flu-like coronavirus, first identified on Dec. 31, has already killed at least 26 people and infected more than 900 worldwide.

On Tuesday, the CDC confirmed the country's first case â€” a Washington state man who has been quarantined in a hospital outside of Seattle after flying back from Wuhan, China.
