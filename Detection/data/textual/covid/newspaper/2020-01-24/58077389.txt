Wall Street has been buoyed by corporate earnings reports with the likes of Intel and American Express helping investors momentarily shake off concerns about the spread of coronavirus in China.

So far the news has been good from American corporations.

Of the 74 of the companies that have reported in the S&P 500 index thus far, 67.6% have reported above analysts’ consensus expectations, while 23% have reported below, compared with an average of 65% of companies outperforming and 20% missing since 1994, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

Stocks have largely recovered losses seen as China’s coronavirus spread after the World Health Organization said Thursday it was too early to declare a global health emergency.

Still, the death toll in China is climbing. China confirmed 830 cases of infection on Friday morning, with the official death count at 26, according to Chinese commission and state media.

“State media has the death toll at 26 and concerns are growing that the travel bans in place will start to have a major impact on the economy with some calling for a 1 percentage point hit or greater with Chinese GDP,” wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at brokerage Oanda, in a daily research note.

Later Friday, IHS Markit is scheduled to publish the latest U.S. purchasing managers index (PMI) data for January at 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time, which may show a modest slowdown in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
