The new coronavirus discovered in China should not be the SARS of 2020 
 The new coronavirus pneumonia which probably has its origin in a seafood market in the central city of Wuhan, China, is fuelling global alarm after several cases were reported in the United States and other countries; however, the risk of a major health emergency similar to the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003 is lower, due to the rapid reaction from the Asian country authorities.

The World Health Organization determined that the outbreak is not yet an international emergency; “make no mistake, this is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a global health emergency,” highlighted Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO.
