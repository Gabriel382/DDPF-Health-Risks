Jan 24 (Reuters) - Gold jumped to a more than two-week high on Friday as the latest updates on the coronavirus dented risk sentiment, and prompted a flight into safe-haven assets.

Spot gold  rose 0.5% to $1,570.10 per ounce by 11:08 a.m. EST (1608 GMT), holding above the key $1,550 level, its highest since Jan. 8.

The metal was up about 0.9% for the week so far.

U.S.  GCcv1 gained 0.3% to $1,569.60 per ounce.

"The entire market just switched into risk-off mood," said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities.

This comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the coronavirus outbreak an emergency for China but not for the rest of the world currently, and added it was tracking it "every minute." spread of the virus ahead of the Lunar New Year, a peak period of travel in China has kept investors concerned.

"Mounting concerns about the virus ahead of the weekend are driving accumulation of gold. ... Clearly, the headlines will get worse before they get better," said Tai Wong, head of base and precious metals derivatives trading at BMO.

Further developments surrounding the outbreak and a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting on Jan. 28-29 will be key drivers for gold into next week, Wong added.

Keeping with a global trend of accommodative monetary policy, the European Central Bank left rates unchanged on Thursday.

Gold is highly sensitive to any reduction in interest rates, which decreases the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.
