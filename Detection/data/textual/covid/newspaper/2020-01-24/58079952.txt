Live updates: CDC confirms a second U.S. patient has tested positive for coronavirus, and 50 people are under investigation in 22 states 
 SEATTLE — There is only one confirmed case of a coronavirus patient in the United States, in Snohomish County, Washington. But the patient’s contacts who are being monitored for signs of the illness jumped from 16 to 43.

Authorities provided no information about the types of individuals being monitored, but the fact that the list expanded is not unexpected.

“This is an evolving investigation, similar to peeling back an onion,” said Heather Thomas, Snohomish Health District spokeswoman. “Our disease investigators, in coordination with other public health partners, are doing daily symptom monitoring and contact investigations.”

Washington state Secretary of Health John Wiesman described the patient’s contacts as being under “active monitoring.” Public health officials call them daily to see if they have a fever, cough or other respiratory issues. If they are experiencing symptoms, they are instructed to call public health officials, who will facilitate medical evaluations.

The contacts are people in both Snohomish and King counties and represent individuals who have had “prolonged contact” with the patient — eating meals or holding meetings together, for example.

The patient, in his 30s, remains in isolation at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Wash. At a Wednesday news conference, Jay Cook, Providence’s chief medical officer, said the man is not confined to his hospital bed and is walking around his room.

The staff in the isolation unit are nurses who volunteer to work with patients who are barred from contact with other patients or staff.

Cook said he expects the man to be able to be discharged soon, assuming he continues to improve. “We hope he will continue on his excellent clinical course and hopefully will be able to return to his home in the very near future,” he said.
