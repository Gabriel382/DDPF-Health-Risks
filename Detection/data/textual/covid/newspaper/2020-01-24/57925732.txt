The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade upgraded the travel warning for Wuhan on Thursday, saying Australians should reconsider their need to travel there.
Biosecurity officers met all passengers on the last flight out of Wuhan to arrive in Sydney on Thursday, handing passengers leaflets written in English and simplified Chinese about what to do if they developed symptoms of respiratory illness.
Scrambling to contain the virus, authorities have shut down most transport including flights in Wuhan, which is home to about 11 million people. Shortly after, the neighbouring cities of Huanggang and Ezhou announced similar measures.

Despite travel restrictions, the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Emergency Committee said it was a "bit too early" to consider the outbreak a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern." Such a designation would have required countries to step up the international response.
"It has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
"Make no mistake though, this is an emergency in China."
