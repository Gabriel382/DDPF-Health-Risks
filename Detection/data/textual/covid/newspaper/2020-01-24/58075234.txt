China steps up fight against Coronavirus, alert in several countries 
 China has ramped up measures to contain the novel Coronavirus, which has so far claimed the lives of 26 people and affected over 800 people globally. The country has put restrictions on public movement in 13 cities, shut temples over the Lunar New Year and even closed the Forbidden City and part of the Great Wall, according to a report by Reuters. Seven Chinese films scrapped premieres and Walt Disney's Shanghai Disney Resort is to shut from Saturday, during the seven-day Lunar New Year holiday, often the busiest time of the year for the park. It is, however, unlikely that the situation will get better soon. The World Health Organization (WHO) Friday predicted that cases of the new coronavirus will continue to rise. "The focus is not so much on the (case) numbers, which we know will go up," WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a Geneva news briefing, adding that Chinese health authorities had officially reported 830 confirmed cases and 26 deaths. "It's still too early to draw conclusions on how severe the virus is." Anticipating an increase in the number of cases, the Chinese city of Wuhan is rapidly building a new 1,000-bed hospital to treat victims, mobilising machinery to get it ready by early next week, the state media said. Meanwhile, the WHO has declared the new coronavirus an emergency for China but stopped short of declaring the epidemic of international concern. Fears over the infection have nevertheless intensified across countries, including in India, which is gearing up to identify possible cases of coronavirus in passengers traveling from China. India Two Indians who travelled to Mumbai from China have been kept in an isolation ward at Kasturba Hospital, and their blood samples have been collected to check for the new strain of coronavirus. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences in the national capital has also set up an isolation ward and kept beds ready for providing treatment to any suspected case of novel coronavirus infection.
