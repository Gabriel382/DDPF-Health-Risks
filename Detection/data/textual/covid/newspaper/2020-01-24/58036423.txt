Wall Street has fed off earnings reports with the likes of Intel and American Express helping investors momentarily shake of concerns about the spread of coronavirus in China.

U.S. investors have been mindful of the coronavirus because such influenza’s can hurt economies if the spread isn’t contained. Wall Street also has said that equity indexes may be sensitive to bad news like viral illness because stocks are teetering at or near records.

“When investors are basically as bullish as they ever get it tends to not take much for them to at least temporarily tap the breaks. The initial uncertainty driven by headlines in the media,” Jeff deGraaf, chairman of Renaissance Macro Research, in a recent report.
