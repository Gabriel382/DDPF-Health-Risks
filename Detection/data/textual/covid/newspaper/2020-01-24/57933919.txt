Hontiveros calls for 30-day travel ban for people from Wuhan 
 MANILA, Philippines — Senator Risa Hontiveros urged the government on Friday to impose a temporary travel ban for at least 30 days on all individuals, who came from or have passed through Wuhan, China where the  2019 novel coronavirus was first detected.

According to the China’s National Health Commission on Friday, the new virus has already reportedly killed at least 25 people and infected over 830 others in various parts of the world.

“This call is on top of the Civil Aeronautics Board’s recent suspension of all flights from Wuhan to the Philippines,” Hontiveros said in a statement.

The Civil Aeronautics Board earlier announced the suspension of all flights between the Philippines and Wuhan due to the new virus scare.

Aside from imposing a temporary travel ban, the senator said authorities must also place Wuhan residents currently in the country and those with flu-like symptoms who have traveled through China in the past 14 days under health surveillance.

“I also strongly urge these individuals to self-quarantine and to report to health authorities any sign of sickness for appropriate medical observation and proper treatment,” she said.

Hontiveros stressed that the new virus “is a global concern that needs international cooperation.”

“It is of the utmost importance that we consider similar precautionary measures being taken by Taiwan, Singapore and our other neighboring countries,” she said.

“I urge that we immediately implement measures that support the Chinese authority s decision to ban travel to and from Wuhan to contain the virus as much as possible,” the senator further said.
