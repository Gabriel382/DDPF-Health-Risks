Boeing Tumbles After Reports Of Further 787 Production Cuts 
 After an exuberant opening - because coronavirus is 'contained' of some such bullshit - Boeing shares have tumbled back into the red after reports that the company is considering another cut to production of its marquee 787 Dreamliner.

Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the matter, that executives are studying whether to trim monthly output by two planes to 10 a month from a pace that was already reduced in October.

“We maintain a disciplined rate-management process, taking into account a host of risks and opportunities,” Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers said when asked about a possible output cut for the Dreamliner. “We will continue to assess the demand environment and make adjustments as appropriate in the future.”

As Bloomberg notes, slowing output of the carbon-composite Dreamliner, with a list price that starts at about $250 million, would crimp a critical source of cash for Boeing as it attempts to recover from a global grounding of the 737 Max following two fatal crashes. The 787 accounted for about 40% of Boeing’s jetliner deliveries in 2019 as the company was barred most of the year from shipping the best-selling Max.

And don't hold your breath for any improvement post-trade-deal...

In October, Boeing executives cited an extended order drought from China when they said the company would slow production to 12 Dreamliners a month from its peak rate of 14.

As goes Boeing, so goes the US equity market?!
