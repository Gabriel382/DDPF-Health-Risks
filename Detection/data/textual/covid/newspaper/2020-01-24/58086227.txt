Coronavirus outbreak: Video shows dead bodies in halls of China hospital 
 Disturbing new video shows dead bodies piling up in the hallways of a hospital in China, as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spiral out of control.

The images from inside Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the deadly viral outbreak, show covered bodies lining corridors as staffers and patients walk about with masks on their faces.

The video, which has been widely shared on social media, was verified by Storyful on Friday.

Officials in Wuhan are scrambling to build a 1,000-bed hospital to address the burgeoning need for treatment of patients sickened by the coronavirus — which has killed at least 26 people and infected hundreds of others.

The new 270,000-square-foot facility is expected to be up and running by Feb. 3.

Wuhan, a city of over 11 million residents, has been on lockdown amid the outbreak, which has been linked to a seafood market there that sold exotic wildlife for human consumption.
