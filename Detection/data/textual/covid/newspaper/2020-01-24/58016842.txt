In April 2003, Beijing built in just seven days the Xiaotangshan Hospital, which People's Daily said treated one-seventh of China's SARS patients at the time.People's Daily called that hospital "a miracle in the history of medicine."The ongoing Wuhan coronavirus can spread from human to human, and has already spread to some healthcare workers treating the infected.It has spread to at least eight other countries: the US, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia.This map shows where it had spread as of Thursday:These countries have quarantined people who are infected, and are monitoring those who have been in close contact with the infected.Other countries, including Scotland and Finland, have suspected cases.Countries around the world are screening passengers in airports for symptoms, and have quarantine procedures in place.
