Coronavirus COBRA meeting called by PM as outbreak 'could hit UK' 
 The Prime Minister has called an emergency COBRA meeting to discuss the threat of coronavirus should the outbreak hit Britain.

Boris Johnson will chair a cross-departmental emergency committee meeting today to discuss a contingency plan for if the virus is detected in the country.

There are currently nine potential cases of the infection in the UK awaiting test results to confirm if they are coronavirus or not.

At least 26 people have died and more than 800 have been infected with the virus, which originated in a seafood market in Wuhan, China. Ten cities are in lockdown and airport biosecurity screenings around the world have been stepped up.

British students returning from China won't be allowed back to some university classes until they've spent time in quarantine.

Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBR) meetings are called in times of crisis so the central government can make fast decisions during a national emergency.

The meetings bring together senior government ministers and civil servants, security and intelligence officials, military chiefs and leaders of the emergency services and councils.

They will then coordinate a response to the emergency.

The last COBRA meeting was called by the Prime Minister in November 2019, in response to the severe flooding in the north of England.
