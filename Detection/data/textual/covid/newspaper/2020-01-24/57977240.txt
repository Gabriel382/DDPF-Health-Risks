                    The deadly coronavirus has spread to other parts of China,
                
            
            
        An NHS-wide system is in place across Wales to "ensure that there is adequate preparation in place" following the outbreak of the coronavirus in China.
Dr Giri Shankar, of Public Health Wales, said a Welsh resident was tested for the virus, but results were clear.
It comes as China widened a lockdown in Hubei province - the centre of the coronavirus outbreak - as the death toll climbed to 26.
Dr Shankar said there is "an NHS all-wide system across Wales".
He said this is to ensure they are prepared "should there be anybody who has returning from China, from the affected areas, presenting to the healthcare systems".
He added that "information keeps changing by the day" but said it suggested the outbreak is contained to certain provinces of China, so healthcare professionals are targeting those returning from affected areas.
Public Health Wales said the risk to the UK population has been assessed as low.
More than a dozen people in the UK have been tested for the new strain of coronavirus, Public Health England has said.
Five people have tested negative while nine others are waiting for results.
In Scotland, where five people were tested, an incident team has been set up to deal with the health threat.
Meanwhile, one man was treated in Belfast for symptoms associated with coronavirus.
All the patients had been in Wuhan - the Chinese city where the virus first broke out - in the last 14 days.
