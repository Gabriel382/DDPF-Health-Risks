China coronavirus infections soar to 830 with 25 deaths as WHO says it’s too early to declare global emergency 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) held off designating a new fast-spreading coronavirus as an international health threat, but did deem it a crisis within China, where the pathogen has infected some 830 people and killed 25.

    
After two days of meetings, WHO determined it was a “bit too early” to label the outbreak an international health emergency on Thursday at a meeting in Geneva, despite the rapidly rising disease toll.
“Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, adding “It has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.”
