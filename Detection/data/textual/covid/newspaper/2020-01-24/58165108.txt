Mexico's Health Ministry reported another suspected case of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) in Mexico. 

José Luis Alomía, director of Epidemiology and coronavirus spokesman disclosed that so far seven cases have been reported and two people, a 57-year-old man in Tamaulipas and a 44-year-old woman in Mexico City, have been cleared of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) strain.

The remaining five cases are yet to be confirmed. Three people in Tepatitlán, Jalisco, one man in Morelia, Michoacán and another woman in Mexico City. 

The new coronavirus strain behind China pneumonia outbreak which probably has its origin in a seafood market in the central city of Wuhan, China, is fuelling global alarm after several cases were reported in several countries.






However, the risk of a major health emergency similar to the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak is lower, due to the rapid reaction from the Asian country authorities.
