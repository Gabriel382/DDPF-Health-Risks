China virus toll jumps to 25 dead, with 830 confirmed cases 
 BEIJING (BLOOMBERG, AFP) - China reported that deaths from a new coronavirus rose to 25, from 18, as it rushes to halt the SARS-like disease, even as the World Health Organisation (WHO) stopped short of calling the infection a global health emergency.

China's national health commission also said on Friday (Jan 24) that the number of confirmed cases has leapt to 830.

The body said authorities also were examining 1,072 suspected cases of the virus.

Restrictions on travel and public gatherings have been implemented in Wuhan, the city in central China where the virus was first detected, as well as in several nearby areas.

Hong Kong and Beijing are cancelling planned holiday activities, according to local officials and state media.
