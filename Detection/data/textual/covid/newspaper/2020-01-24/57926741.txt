NJ patient being evaluated for deadly coronavirus 
 WOODLAND PARK, N.J. – A patient at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey was being evaluated Thursday night for possible infection with the coronavirus that originated in central China and has caused worldwide concern of a possible epidemic.

The patient, a 25-year-old woman, was transported to the hospital Thursday evening by the Edgewater Emergency Medical Services, according to EMS sources.

"The hospital, the Department of Health and local health officials are working together to gather additional information," said Donna Leusner, a spokeswoman for the state Health Department. "No definitive diagnosis has been made regarding the patient.

"As a precautionary measure, the hospital is following all appropriate infection control protocols," she said. That would include isolating the patient.

Hackensack Meridian Health officials confirmed that a patient was being evaluated, in a statement from Nancy Radwin, a spokeswoman.

The new type of virus has sickened more than 800 people in China, most in the central city of Wuhan. It causes respiratory illness, including pneumonia, and has spread to other cities in China as well as to Thailand, South Korea, and Taiwan. Authorities say 25 deaths have been reported in China, most among people with underlying medical conditions..

On Wednesday, the federal Centers for Disease Control confirmed the first case in the United States, in a resident of Snohomish County, Washington, who had returned from a trip to Wuhan.

New or novel viruses are of concern because humans lack immunity to them and there are no vaccines or specific treatments. The patients have been treated with supportive care.
