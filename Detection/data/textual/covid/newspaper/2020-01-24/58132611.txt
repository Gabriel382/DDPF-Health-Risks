France confirms 2 cases of deadly coronavirus, Europe’s first 
 The deadly new virus that has sickened hundreds of people in Asia and at least two in the U.S. has reached Europe for the first time. France’s health minister told reporters Friday that two patients have been diagnosed with the Wuhan coronavirus, a pneumonia-like infection that has claimed more than two dozen lives since it was first discovered in central China last month. One of France’s patients is a 48-year-old man who’s originally from China and had recently visited the country, French newspaper Le Monde reported. The man is in isolation at a hospital in Bordeaux, but his condition was not immediately clear. The other person is at a hospital in Paris, but there were details about that case.The announcement marks the first time the mysterious virus has been confirmed in Europe. Earlier on Friday, a Chicago woman became the second U.S. patient diagnosed with the illness, following confirmation earlier this week that a Washington State man has also contracted the virus. Both had traveled to Wuhan, a large Chinese city where the virus is believed to have originated. As of Friday, the newly discovered coronavirus has killed at least 26 people and sickened more than 800 others. All deaths and the vast majority of the cases have been reported in China, but a few patients have been diagnosed with the virus in neighboring countries, including Japan, South Korea and Vietnam.The infection is part of a large family of coronaviruses that causes respiratory illness in people who have contact with animals, especially bats and camels, health officials have said.
