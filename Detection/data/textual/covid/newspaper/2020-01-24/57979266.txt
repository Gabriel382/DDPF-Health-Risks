China locks down 10 cities and pledges new hospital within six days as Wuhan virus spreads 
 China on Friday confirmed it has now imposed travel restrictions on 10 cities, home to more than 32 million people, and pledged to build a new hospital within six days in Wuhan, the epicentre of a deadly virus that is sweeping across the country and through Asia.

The number of cases of the new coronavirus, which causes respiratory problems, has jumped to 830 and the death toll risen to at least 26, with two fatalities now reported outside of Wuhan, in Hubei province and the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, which borders Russia and Mongolia.

Wuhan, a city of 11 million, was suddenly quarantined on Thursday morning, with residents given a 10am deadlineÂ before road, rail and air transport links were severed indefinitely in an effort to contain the virus, which is a similar pathogen to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and can spread between humans.

A day later, a total of 10 cities in central Hubei province suspended some public transportation over the coronavirus outbreak, the Hubei Daily reported on Friday.

Buses in cities of Chibi, Xiantao, Zhijiang, Qianjiang, Xianning, Huangshi and Enshi have suspended services. Ezhou city has shut its train stations.

In Zhijiang city, all public venues have been shut down except hospitals, supermarkets, farmers' market, gas stations and drug stores, said Hubei Daily.
