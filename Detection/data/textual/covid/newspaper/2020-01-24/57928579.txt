Maharashtra: Travel plans to China trip after disease outbreak | Pune News - Times of India 
 PUNE: The coronavirus outbreak has cast a shadow on citizens’ China travel plans, prompting cancellation of some bookings and enquiries about the plausibility of spending summer holidays there.Sources in Indian travel and hotel booking e-commerce website ixigo stated that search enquiries for Beijing and Shanghai had dropped. Data showed 40-45% decrease in bookings from Mumbai to China in January after the coronavirus outbreak as compared to the December travel figures.Several Puneites plan trips to China from Mumbai, which has direct flight connections to the country.Travel companies claimed that almost all their clients booked for China were calling them up to ask if they should cancel their upcoming trips to the country. Vikas Agarwal, the director of VT Travel, told TOI that four passengers who had booked air tickets to the US with a transit stop at Shanghai, China, cancelled the entire booking on Wednesday fearing issues in clearing immigration upon reaching the US.“The US has begun screening travellers from China for the new virus and my clients were worried about facing problems while clearing immigration in the US if they touched down in China during the journey. They made a fresh booking to the US with an airline with a transit stop in Dubai,” said Agarwal.He said his clients had to bear an additional cost of Rs50,000 for cancelling the earlier booking, and another Rs1 lakh for fresh and closer-to-travel-date booking.Balu Ramachandran, senior VP, Cleartrip, told TOI, “We have started to see some signs of travellers refraining from booking to China after the virus outbreak and the subsequent travel advisory. The last week registered a 33% dip in Pune specific bookings from the week before that. We are yet to observe any immediate traveller reactions in terms of bookings’ cancellations to the country.”Santosh Gupta, the owner of Shree Vinayak Holidays, said his company had blocked air tickets to China for seven business travellers from the city in February. “But the clients called me up informing about cancelling their travel to China after the news of the virus outbreak,” said Gupta.Aloke Bajpai, co-founder, ixigo, said, “We haven’t seen immediate cancellations on current bookings, but search enquiries for Beijing and Shanghai have dropped by 37% after advisories were issued for travel to China. A prolonged outbreak might result in a decrease in business travel bookings from India, which form the majority of the outbound numbers to China.”Rishikesh Pujari, the director of Vihar Travels, said, “We are closely monitoring the situation and awaiting an official travel advisory from the Chinese government.”
