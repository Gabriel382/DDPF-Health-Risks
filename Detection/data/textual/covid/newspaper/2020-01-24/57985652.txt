Coronavirus scare shutters Shanghai Disney 
 Shanghai Disneyland (NYSE:DIS) will be closed from Saturday to help prevent the spread of a deadly coronavirus that broke out in the Chinese city Wuhan.

It's a crucial time for the theme park, with China on a seven-day Lunar New Year holiday starting Friday.

Last year, Shanghai Disney had to stop selling tickets to visitors as the park was overcrowded.
