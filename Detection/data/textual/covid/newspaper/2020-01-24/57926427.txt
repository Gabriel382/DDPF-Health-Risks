GPs to quiz all patients with a cough to stop spread of deadly coronavirus 
 GPs have been ordered to ask all patients with a cough or fever about their recent travel.

New NHS guidance aimed at limiting the spread of the deadly coronavirus says doctors must immediately isolate sick individuals who visited China.

Contact should be limited and consultation rooms closed off — with critically ill patients to be quarantined in hospital.

Nose and throat samples must be sent to labs for tests and if a patient is confirmed to have coronavirus they will be transferred to specialist isolation units in London, Liverpool or Newcastle.

Patients calling NHS 111 will also hear a new recorded message encouraging them to report any flu-like symptoms if they have travelled to China.

Public Health England has upgraded the risk to the population from coronavirus from “very low” to “low”.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has updated its travel advice for those heading to China, urging caution.

It warned: “In light of the latest medical information, we are now advising against all but essential travel to Wuhan.

“British nationals travelling to China should remain vigilant and check our travel advice on gov.uk.”
