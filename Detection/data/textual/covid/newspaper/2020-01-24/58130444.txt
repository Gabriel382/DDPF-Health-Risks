Coronavirus reaches Europe as France confirms two cases 
 France has announced two cases of coronavirus, the deadly new virus from China. The two confirmed cases, the first in Europe, were announced by the health minister Agnes Buzyn. She said that both of the people had travelled to China. The minister said she expects more cases. “We have two cases,” she said. “We will probably have other cases.” The minister said she believes that one reason why France is the first European country to have confirmed cases is that it has developed a test allowing medics to rapidly diagnose the sickened. One of the people, a 48-year-old man, passed through Wuhan, the epicentre in China for the virus, before travelling to France on Wednesday, the minister said. That person is in hospital in the south-western city of Bordeaux. The other person is in hospital in Paris. The minister said that that person also travelled to China but that she has little other information about the case.
