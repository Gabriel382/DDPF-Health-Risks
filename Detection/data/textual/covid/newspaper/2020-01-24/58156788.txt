Here’s what Wuhan, China looks like under quarantine for coronavirus 
 It’s been described as unprecedented — the quarantining of millions of people in a central Chinese city while health care workers try to suppress a virus proliferating across the country.
Wuhan and a number of surrounding municipalities are under lockdown, with travel networks and services shut down or restricted.
At least 26 people in China have died because of the virus, two of them outside the Hubei province. Nearly 900 people have been infected as of Jan. 24.
Those within the borders of the quarantine are living under unusual circumstances.
Typically bustling areas, like train stations and public spaces, are practically bare.
