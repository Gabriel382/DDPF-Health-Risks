MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s tourism watchdog said on Friday it was recommending that travel operators stop sales of packages to China due to the new coronavirus. 
It recommended that Russians refrain from visiting China until the “epidemiological situation stabilizes”. 
China is taking measures to contain the coronavirus, which has killed 26 people and infected more than 800.
