Tennessee student being tested for coronavirus 
 A student at Tennessee Tech University in Cookeville, Tenn. is being tested for the coronavirus, the school confirmed.

The university said the student, who met the criteria for testing based on recent travels, has “very mild symptoms.”

“On Thursday, a student at Tennessee Tech University presented with very mild symptoms, and with his recent travel history met the criteria for testing for possible infection with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Health providers quickly recognized that the patient met the criteria for coronavirus testing, but nothing has been confirmed. The individual is being kept isolated while precautionary testing is being conducted. Tennessee Tech and healthcare professionals continue to communicate and collaborate with the Tennessee Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control.

The Tennessee Department of Health advises that while we await test results, there are no specific actions other individuals need to take. As soon as more information about the situation becomes available it will be made aware to be made to the public.”

Cookeville is located about 80 miles east of Nashville.

Officials recently confirmed the first U.S. case of coronavirus – a respiratory illness that has sickened hundreds and killed at least 17 people in China – in a 30-year-old man in Washington state.

Symptoms of the virus include runny nose, cough, difficulty breathing, sore throat and fever and, in some patients, life-threatening pneumonia.

There is no specific treatment for the new virus or vaccine to prevent it.
