Where is Wuhan and did coronavirus start in the Chinese city? 
 THE death toll in china has risen to 26 and a further 830 people are infected with the deadly coronavirus.

Public Health England announced that 14 people in the UK have been tested for the disease. Here's the latest.

Wuhan, in Eastern China, is the capital of Hubei province, People's Republic of China.

It is the largest city in Hubei and is the most heavily populated city in Central China with a population of 11 million.

It is considered as the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural and education centre of Central China.

The city is a major transportation hub, bustling with railways, roads and expressways connecting it to other cities.

The Chinese food market at the centre of the coronavirus was selling live koalas, crocodiles, peacocks, snakes, rats and wolf pups to be eaten.

The SARS outbreak in 2003 also started in 'wet markets', where outdoor stalls selling raw meat within spitting distance of live, caged animals, often kept in inhumane conditions.

Chinese officials have now banned meat trade in wet markets like Huanan, which was shut down on January 1. The Wildlife Conservation Society said: "Poorly regulated, live animal markets mixed with illegal wildlife trade offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spillover from wildlife hosts into the human population,"

At least 10 cities in the central Chinese province have been slapped with travel restrictions.

All bus, subway and ferry services have been suspended and outbound trains and planes have been cancelled.

It's been reported that roadblocks have also been put in place.

The lockdown comes on the eve of Lunar New Year, one of the most important dates in the Chinese calendar, where millions of people travel to see loved ones.

 The city is rapidly building a new 1,000 bed hospital to cope with the rising number of victims.
