All clear for 14 people in UK tested for coronavirus, but more... 
 All 14 people tested for coronavirus in the UK have been given the all-clear but checks are ongoing on other people, the Chief Medical Officer for England has said.

Professor Chris Whitty spoke following a meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall, chaired by Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

All the people tested in the UK had visited Wuhan – the Chinese city where the outbreak originated.

Four out five patients tested in Scotland were Chinese nationals.

One of those cleared in the UK was Michael Hope, 45, who spent two days in quarantine this week after returning to Newcastle from Wuhan.
