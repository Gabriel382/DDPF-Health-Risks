PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (CBS 58) – Several University of Wisconsin-Platteville students who recently traveled from China are being monitored for possible coronavirus.

The six students are currently living together in a residence hall, but are not under any quarantine or isolation.

Milwaukee Dr. Jorge Ramallo recommends taking similar precautions you would take for the flu.

"Making sure that you're washing your hands thoroughly, especially if you're in a shared space or public transportation...practicing hygiene and staying away from people that might look like they are very sick and just protecting yourself and your family."

UW-Platteville says it is in contact with the CDC and the Grant County Health Department.CBS 58 reached out to several other Wisconsin schools to see if they are taking precautions.

UW-Milwaukee says they are not aware of any of their students studying in China or any faculty working there.

UW-Madison says they are well-prepared for public health concerns like the coronavirus, but right now they say their biggest concern is influenza.
