 Queensland Health says two people are being tested for the deadly coronavirus, but four others have been tested and cleared.

Four others have been tested and cleared, Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young announced on Friday.

In China, believed to be the virus’ place of origin, authorities have locked down some 20 million people – banning planes and trains from leaving the city of Wuhan.

Hours after announcing the Wuhan lockdown, authorities in neighbouring Huanggang city announced public transport and train services would be suspended at midnight, while people were told to not leave the city of 7.5 million.

So far the virus has claimed the lives of 18 people in China and triggered warnings across the world.

On Thursday, a plane arrived in Sydney from Wuhan, with health authorities immediately testing all on board.
