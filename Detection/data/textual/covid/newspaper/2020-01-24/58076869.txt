CDC Confirms Second US Coronavirus Case In Chicago, Monitoring 63 Other "Potential Cases" 
 The CDC has confirmed the second case of Coronavirus in a Chicago woman who recently traveled to Wuhan. She has been quarantined, and investigators are looking to track down anyone she may have had contact with.

Other cases have been rumored in Texas and at LAX, but apparently none have been confirmed. The first case emerged earlier this week in Washington State.
