Remain Alert: As Wuhan coronavirus continues to spread, Indian authorities must prepare contingencies 
 With the Wuhan coronavirus continuing to spread, Chinese authorities have locked down the city of 11 million people which is the epicentre of the disease, suspending train, airline, ferry, subway and bus services. Seventeen people have died in the outbreak, all of them in and around Wuhan, and more than 630 have been infected. Meanwhile, Singapore and Vietnam have reported their first cases of the Wuhan coronavirus, while a suspected case of an Indian nurse in Saudi Arabia was later found to be an infection from another coronavirus strain. But 25 Indian students are trapped in Wuhan due to the lockdown.





Given the circumstances and with many Indians traveling to China in recent times, Indian authorities must prepare for the spread of the infection here. Seven Indian airports are already screening passengers coming in from China. Hospitals too should be on high alert and prepare isolation facilities for suspected cases. The Wuhan coronavirus symptoms are similar to seasonal influenza, making it tricky to detect. Therefore, it would be better for authorities to err on the side of caution.

 

Tha said, Kerala’s experience in successfully tackling the Nipah virus outbreak in 2018 shows that such infections can be contained with adequate planning and infrastructure. In fact, the Nipah virus was traced to fruit bats and now early reports suggest that the Wuhan coronavirus too could have originated in bats. Thus, authorities must keep their guard up and leave no stone unturned to prevent the spread of the infection in India.
