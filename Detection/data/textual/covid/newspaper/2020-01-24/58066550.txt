Stocks shrug off spreading coronavirus, driving toward all-time highs 
 FOX Business' Neil Cavuto, Payne Capital senior wealth adviser Courtney Dominguez, GOP fundraiser Noelle Nikpour and Fairfax Global Markets CEO Paul Dietrich discuss how the Democrats' efforts to impeach President Trump will impact economic growth.




U.S. equity markets were trading near record highs Friday morning, shrugging off reports that the coronavirus continues to spread.
The coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened 830 and killed 26 in the country, according to the National Health Commission. Cases of the virus have been found in the U.S., Japan, Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Nepal.
Friday’s gains come after U.S. stocks staged a comeback the prior afternoon following the World Health Organization’s declaration that the outbreak had “not yet become a global health emergency."
