Here's what happened to the stock market on Friday 
 The Dow slid 170.36 points, or 0.58%, to 28,989.73. The S&P 500 dropped 0.90% to 3,295.50. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.93% to 9,314.91. Rising fears over the coronavirus' impact on the global economy left investors dumping stocks in search of safer assets.

The 10-year Treasury yield broke below 1.7%, a key level watched by traders. Gold futures climbed 0.4%.

Airline stocks United and American fell 3.51% and 4.03%, respectively, amid fears the coronavirus spread would hurt the travel industry. Boeing, meanwhile, closed 1.66% higher after staging a massive turnaround.
