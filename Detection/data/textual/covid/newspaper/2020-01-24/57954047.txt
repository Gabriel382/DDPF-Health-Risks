Indian shares inch higher as focus shifts to Federal budget 
 BENGALURU, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Indian shares edged higher in early trading on Friday, as investors assessed a clutch of corporate earnings reports and awaited the release of the Federal budget. 
India’s NSE Nifty 50 index was up 0.2% at 12,203.10 by 0430 GMT, while the SP BSE Sensex was 0.19% higher at 41,441.24. 
Poorly received earnings from top Indian companies over the last two weeks have dented risk appetite, with investors now keeping a close watch on the Feb. 1 budget for clues on the government’s move to revive economic growth, which has slipped to a more than six-year low. 
“There have been mixed cues in the last couple of days, China is a cause of concern and domestically earnings have not been very encouraging,” said Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Securities in Mumbai. 
“Now there is anticipation about the budget, lot of hope is being built around it and the outcome will give further direction to markets.” 
Meanwhile, other Asian markets were subdued on fears that a new coronavirus in China could spread faster as millions of people would be travelling over the week-long holiday.
