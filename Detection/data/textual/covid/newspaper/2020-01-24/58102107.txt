Oil continues to bleed red on China virus fears 
 Crude oil (USO ) trades at its lowest levels since early November and on track for its worst week since May, as the coronavirus outbreak continues to pressure prices.

WTIÂ March crude to $54.15/bbl; Brent March crude to $60.51/bbl; WTI tracks to the end of the week with a 7%-plus loss, while Brent is down ~6% for the week.

"When [Chinese] cities are placed under quarantine, and public transit is shut down, by definition that reduces economic activity and has a negative impact on energy demand, oil included," says Raymond James analyst John Freeman.

Weakness in oil and gas stocks (XLE ) following lower crude prices has widened this week's sector loss to 4.3% vs. the 0.5% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500.

Among noteworthy losers in the group: CXO , NOV , CLR , COG , EOG , MRO , DVN .
