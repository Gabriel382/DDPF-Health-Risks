The Dow is currently on track to post a losing week, its second in four weeks, while the Nasdaq is likely to rise for the seventh week in a row after a record close Thursday. The S&P 500 is just below breakeven for the week, and would post its eighth weekly gain in since weeks if it can erase that deficit.

Ford (F) expects to take a pretax hit of about $2.2 billion in the fourth-quarter due to contributions to its employee pension plans and retirement benefits.
