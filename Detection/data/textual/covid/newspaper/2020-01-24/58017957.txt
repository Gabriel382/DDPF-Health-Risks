Coronavirus Has Not Affected Indonesia: Jokowi 
 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - President Joko Widodo or Jokowi has asked the public to maintain vigilance against the possible spread of the coronavirus despite the absence of the virus in the country.“What is important is we have to remain vigilant, be careful,” he said at the State Palace, Presidential Complex, Central Jakarta, Friday, January 24, 2020. Jokowi said he had ordered Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto to keep a close watch on the possible spread of the virus. Among the measures was the installment of thermal detectors at places of tourist arrivals--particularly tourists from affected countries. Jokowi also asserted he had yet to receive any report regarding the outbreak of the virus in the country. “According to the reports I have received to date, and hopefully afterwards, no one has contracted the coronavirus,” he said. Reports were rife yesterday that a person at a BRI building had contracted the virus upon returning from Wuhan, China, where the virus was first reported. Later reports said the person only suffered from an ordinary inflammation. The Chinese government has taken emergency measures with regard to the coronavirus outbreak, among them by blockading the access from and to Wuhan. The virus, which triggers respiratory problems and fever, is allegedly caused by seafood consumption in Wuhan.  Reporter: Egy AdyatamaTranslator: Safira Andini
