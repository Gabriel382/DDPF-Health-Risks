Wall Street slides on coronavirus fears, Intel offers support 
 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday, as investors were cautious heading into the weekend amid renewed concerns over the fallout of a coronavirus outbreak from China.

Intel Corp stood out with an 8.4% gain after the chipmaker forecast better-than-expected 2020 earnings, joining many of its peers to signal a recovery in chip demand.

After a record open for the Nasdaq, Wall Street's main indexes lost ground as U.S. health officials confirmed a second U.S. case of the coronavirus in a Chicago woman and said as many as 63 potential cases were being investigated.

That added to nerves after the outbreak in China killed 26 people and infected more than 800 in the past week, raising concerns about its fallout on the global economy.

"It's been a headline risk for the market," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.

"The question becomes whether or not this continues to spread quickly. The other issue is it's a Friday. Do investors want to go long into the weekend or do they want to take some profits? Because the virus is not going to recede."
