He told China Economic Net that the university workers advised students to avoid crowds.
They have provided free surgical masks and new year gifts for international students. The staff also spray disinfection in teaching buildings and dormitory building to prevent and control the virus. The canteen and library both are closed now as the students have left for the upcoming Spring Festival, or the Chinese Lunar New Year.
