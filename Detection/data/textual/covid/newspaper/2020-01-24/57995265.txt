Aklan town monitoring Chinese tourist arrivals in Boracay 
 The local government of Malay in Aklan is monitoring visitors of the famous Boracay Island, particularly those coming from China.

Malay acting Mayor Frolibar Bautista said they continue to receive advisories from the provincial capitol regarding tourist arrivals at the Kalibo International Airport.

Bautista was referring to the 3 Chinese tourists with influenza-like symptoms who arrived in Kalibo last week and the 135 tourists who arrived Thursday morning from Wuhan, the Chinese city where virus originated.

The local government is waiting for guidelines regarding Chinese tourists coming to Boracay Island for the Lunar New Year.

Meanwhile, Bautista said the last cruise ship that visited Boracay was on Thursday and most of the guests were Europeans.

On Thursday, Philippine aviation authorities banned flights to the Chinese city of Wuhan as a precaution, following the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus.

Wuhan, where the first reported case of the novel coronavirus came from, remains on lockdown, halting exit and entry flights and train operations.
