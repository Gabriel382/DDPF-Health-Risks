Two quarantined and tested for coronavirus in Queensland, four tested in NSW 
 Queensland Health says two people are being tested for the deadly coronavirus, but four others have been tested and cleared.

Four others have been tested and cleared, Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young announced on Friday.

Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young has urged anyone with symptoms of the respiratory disease to go to their doctor.

"We've already tested four individuals who were suspected cases. All four came back negative," she told reporters on Friday.

"'We've got another two suspects at the moment that we're assessing who may need testing."

NSW Health announced four cases were under investigation but stressed there have been no confirmed cases of the virus.

"We will not be disclosing the hospital locations of patients under investigation for privacy reasons," NSW Health spokesperson said.

So far there have been no confirmed cases in Australia.

The virus originated in China and has already spread to seven other countries, including to the US, Vietnam and Japan.

It has killed 25 people in China and infected more than 800 there. None of the international cases confirmed so far have involved deaths.

In China, authorities have locked down some 20 million people – banning planes and trains from leaving the city of Wuhan.

Hours after announcing the Wuhan lockdown, authorities in neighbouring Huanggang city announced public transport and train services would be suspended at midnight, while people were told to not leave the city of 7.5 million.

So far the virus has claimed the lives of 18 people in China and triggered warnings across the world.

On Thursday, a plane arrived in Sydney from Wuhan, with health authorities immediately testing all on board.
