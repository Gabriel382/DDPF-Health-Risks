2nd Case of Wuhan Coronavirus Confirmed in S. Korea 
 South Korea has confirmed the second case of a mysterious pneumonia-like illness that has been sweeping China and elsewhere. 


The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(KCDC) said on Friday that a person who arrived in Incheon International Airport from the central Chinese city of Wuhan a few days ago tested positive for the new strain of coronavirus. The epidemiological study of the patient is underway. 


It is the second case declared in the country in less than a week following the confirmation of a 35-year-old woman with Chinese nationality on Monday, who also arrived the previous day from Wuhan, where the epidemic first broke out late last month. 


The first confirmed patient in South Korea has been treated in isolation at a state-designated hospital in Incheon and is in stable condition.
