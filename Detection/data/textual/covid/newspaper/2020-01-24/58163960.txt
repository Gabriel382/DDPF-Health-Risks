Wardy's Wagers: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s days are numbered as Man Utd lose again 
 I’ve not had a lot of luck health-wise down the last few years.

I suffer from an inferiority complex but it’s not a very good one.

I’ve also got a phobia of over-engineered buildings. It’s a complex complex complex.

Years ago I had a neck brace fitted and I’ve never looked back since.

But I’ve had bad advice from doctors.

I said I needed help over my obsession with stealing painkillers.

They told me to take some pills. The security guard who nabbed me in Boots didn’t want to hear my excuses.

I had a really bad rash and my GP prescribed Viagra. I asked if that would help cure it and she said no. But it does keep the sheets off my legs at night. My girlfriend got me a “get better soon” card. I wasn’t even sick, I just think she thinks I could be better.

I can only hope I don’t get the new deadly Coronavirus.

It probably isn’t spread by drinking beer but I’m sticking to Sol for the time being just in case.

And apparently those infected with it get much better if they pop a slice of lime in their mouth.

Man Utd fans are getting sick to the back teeth of losing at Old Trafford and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s days must surely be numbered.
