Corona virus - DER SPIEGEL - International 
 Two days before the Chinese New Year, at a time when families across the country get together to celebrate, the merchants at the Huanan fish market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan should have been raking in profits. In a normal year, they would be selling large amounts of fish and shellfish, and the countless other kinds of meat for which the market is famous. This includes beef and pork, rabbit and donkey, fox and crocodile, giant Chinese salamander, snake, badger, rat and camel, and much more.

Some wild animals are sold alive – and illegally. But eating rare meat has a long history in China.

As this Year of the Rat begins in China, however, nothing is normal in Wuhan, a city of 11 million. The police have blocked off the market’s two-story building with white-and-blue warning tape. Behind it, visitors can see heavy grates and hallways – a tiled floor, drainage gutters, stands lined up left and right. The blue shutters are pulled down, with no sign of life. Behind a window, the water bubbles in an otherwise empty fish tank.
