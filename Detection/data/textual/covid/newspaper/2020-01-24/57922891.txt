Four investigated for coronavirus in NSW 
 Health authorities in NSW have confirmed that four people in the state are currently under investigation for potential coronavirus infection.

NSW Health on Friday said all four people were in undisclosed hospitals around the state and that none had yet been confirmed coronavirus sufferers.

Only one person - who had been in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in the past fortnight and has since come down with flu-like symptoms - had been under investigation by NSW Health on Thursday.

Wuhan is the epicentre of the virus and outbound travel is now banned.

No one who arrived in Sydney on a flight from Wuhan on Thursday self-reported or were deemed ill by a medical team at Sydney Airport.

However the disease - which has killed 18 people and infected hundreds - has an incubation period of a week or more.
