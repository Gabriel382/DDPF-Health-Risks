Coronavirus vaccine available in as little as six months 
 Queensland researchers have been asked to help develop a vaccine for China's deadly coronavirus as more cities are placed in lock down to try to stop the spread of the disease. The vaccine could be rolled out in as little as six months due to researchers fast-tracking technology that was already in development to find a cure. At least 25 people have died from the deadly coronavirus in China, China's National Health Commission has confirmed.
