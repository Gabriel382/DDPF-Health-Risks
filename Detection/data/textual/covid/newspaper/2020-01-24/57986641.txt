Coronavirus test - how is it diagnosed and is there a vaccine? 
 CHINESE authorities are desperately trying to stop the spread of Coronavirus after the death toll has risen to 26.

More than a dozen people have been tested for the virus in the UK, but how is it diagnosed? Here's all you need to know.

Five people have so far been tested negative and the other nine people are waiting for results.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was an "increased likelihood" of cases in the UK, but that "we are well prepared" to deal with them.

He also said: "The UK is one of the first countries to have developed a world-leading test for the new coronavirus."

It has similar symptoms to the common cold, making it tricky to identify early.

According to CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the symptoms include:

Doctors may order laboratory tests on respiratory specimens and serum, part of your blood, to detect human coronaviruses. The testing is more likely is you are suspected of having MERS.

At the moment there is no vaccine to protect people against the virus, but researchers are looking to develop one.

The UK's expected measures do not appear to include a medical screening of passengers at the airport for signs of the virus, as the UK did in 2014 following the Ebola outbreak.
