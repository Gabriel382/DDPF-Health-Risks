Asian stocks quiet on Lunar New Year's eve after a turbulent week 
 Hong Kong (CNN Business) Asian markets were mostly muted Friday on the eve of Lunar New Year celebrations, signaling caution after a broad sell-off the previous day over growing coronavirus fears.

Hong Kong's, closed upnearly 0.2% Friday during a shortened trading session. Japan'swere last up about 0.1%.

Chinese markets were closed, and won't reopen until late next week.

The relative calm came a day after China'sposted its worst single-day percentage drop in more than eight months as the deadly coronavirus spread across the country, causing officials to place Wuhan, the central Chinese city where it originated, and two of its neighboring cities, under a partial lockdown

The sell-off Thursday was "the most significant pre-[Lunar New Year] stock market rout on record," said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiTrader, in a note to clients this week.

China's coronavirus problem is getting worse. As of Friday, the death toll from the disease had jumped to at least 26 . More than 800 people have been infected, mostly in mainland China, though the disease has spread as far as the United States.

That helped soothe traders' jitters and provided markets with a sense of calm, Innes wrote Friday.

Still, investors are nervous that the crisis could stick around for a while.

"There are rising concerns that the economic impact could extend beyond the" Lunar New Year, analysts at Jefferies, wrote in a note Thursday.

Companies with headquarters or significant business in Wuhan and the surrounding area "may suffer the most," they added.

Correction: An earlier version of this report incorrectly included South Korean markets, which are closed.
