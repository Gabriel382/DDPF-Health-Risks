(Reuters) - London’s main index rebounded sharply on Friday as investor nerves were eased after the World Health Organisation issued a measured assessment of the new coronavirus in China, though Just Eat slid on a probe of its buyout by Takeaway.com. 
The new SARS-like virus has killed 25 people and infected more than 800 so far. While the WHO termed the outbreak “an emergency in China”, it refrained from declaring it an epidemic of international concern.     
The FTSE 100 looked set to end a four-day losing streak as it rose 1%. The FTSE 250 advanced 0.6%. 
Lagging the blue-chips was Just Eat, which skidded 3% after Britain’s competition watchdog said it would investigate Takeaway’s takeover of the food delivery company.
