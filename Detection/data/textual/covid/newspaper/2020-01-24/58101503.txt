Delta issues waiver following coronavirus illness 
 Delta has issued a travel waiver as the airline closely monitors the evolving situation in response to an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus originating in China.

This waiver allows customers with flexibility in their travel plans to make a one-time change to their itinerary without incurring a change fee.

Travelers with Wuhan in their journey are being screened by the CDC upon arrival to New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago-O'Hare and Los Angeles, in addition to screenings in China. Other U.S. airports are also reportedly screening passengers who have Wuhan as part of their travel journey.

Yesterday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a level 3 travel advisory​, which recommends travelers avoid nonessential travel to Wuhan, China. Delta continues to be in direct contact with the CDC and is following their guidelines.
