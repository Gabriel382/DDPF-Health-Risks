CEE MARKETS-Currencies gain after euro zone PMIs, Czech bond rally... 
 WARSAW, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Central European currencies gained on Friday, as better than expected PMI data from the euro zone helped restore risk appetite that had taken a hit in recent days from the outbreak of coronavirus in China. IHS Markit flash PMI data for the European Union's economic powerhouse Germany showed its private sector gained momentum in January, while euro zone data showed increased optimism about the year ahead despite business activity remaining weak at the start of the year. "I think the main reason that CEE currencies gained today in the morning are better-than-expected flash PMIs released in the morning ... the risk appetite is back on the market," said Santander Bank Polska economist Marcin Sulewski. At 0926 GMT the Hungarian forint was 0.34% firmer against the euro at 335.70, while the Czech crown gained 0.19% against the common currency to be bid at 25.110 and the Polish zloty rose 0.10% to 4.2408. Czech bond yields were mixed after a two-day dive lower as expectations the country's weighting in a key JPMorgan emerging markets bond index will rise at the end of January. One fund manager said JPMorgan had sent a note on Tuesday saying the October 2033 bond would be put in on the last day of January, pushing the country's weighting up by 37 basis points. The 2033 bond yield has dropped around 30 basis points since Tuesday's close. The Czech Republic, whose credit rating is the best in central Europe, has a current weighting in JPMorgan's GBI-EM Global Diversified index for local currency government debt of 3.69%. Benchmark Polish 10-year yields climbed over 4 basis points to 2.30% as investor focus shifted from coronavirus to the flash PMI data. Stocks also got a boost from the risk-on mood, with Poland's WIG 20 index up 0.68% at 0941 GMT and Prague's PX index gaining 0.64% as it contimued to hover around multi-year highs.
