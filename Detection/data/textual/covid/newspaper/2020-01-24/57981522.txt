66 more suspected coronavirus cases as officials broaden list of symptoms 
 Hong Kong reported 66 more suspected cases of the Wuhan coronavirus during the night as a result of broader criteria for people showing symptoms, bringing the total number of suspected cases to 236 as of 8am on Friday.
Dr Chung Kin-lai, the Hospital Authority’s director of quality and safety, said the new cases were received from Friday midnight until 8am. Among the 236 patients, 119 were hospitalised and placed in isolation.
He said the two patients who were tested positive for the virus on Wednesday were in a stable condition, while adding there was no cause for alarm at the moment.


“As the Department of Health has widened its criteria for reporting a suspected case, there has been an increase in the reported cases over the past night. Anyone with relevant symptoms will be treated as a suspected case now,” he said.

As of Friday noon, the death toll in mainland China hit 26, among at least 875 confirmed cases. The virus has spread to other areas of the world, including Thailand, Japan, and South Korea, while Macau reported its second case on Thursday, a 66-year-old tourist from Wuhan.
The first coronavirus patient in Hong Kong was a 39-year-old mainland tourist, who arrived at West Kowloon on Tuesday. The second, a 56-year-old Hongkonger, had visited Wuhan.
The two cases were treated as “highly suspected” after preliminary diagnostic tests returned positive results on Wednesday. Subsequent DNA test results confirmed their diagnosis on Thursday.
Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the communicable diseases branch at the Centre for Health Protection, said three people who had been in close contact with the two confirmed patients in the city had been placed in quarantine at Princess Margaret Hospital and Tuen Mun Hospital.
