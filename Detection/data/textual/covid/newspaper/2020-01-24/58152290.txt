NYC shops hit with face mask shortage amid coronavirus fears 
 Shops in the Big Apple sold out of face masks Friday amid fears over the deadly coronavirus.

Pharmacies and medical supply stores in Manhattan are bracing for a shortage of the protective gear — with some reporting empty shelves — as the number of people infected by the flu-like virus surged worldwide, workers told The Post.

“We are totally out of stock of face masks. There’s been an uptick in sales for the last three days,” said Rob Luckman, a manager at Halpern Pharmacy on 23rd Street near Second Avenue.

He said the pharmacy had sold hundreds of the masks in recent days due to concerns about the outbreak — which has soared to 830 infections worldwide, and triggered screenings of Chinese travelers at JFK airport.

Many of the customers flooding the pharmacy were of Chinese decent — buying the supplies for relatives who can’t get them back home, where residents face serious shortages, Luckman said.

“The biggest thing I’m seeing is people buying them to send them back to China,” he said. “One doctor told me he bought a box for his family and friends who can’t get them there.”


In other cases, surgeons and medical students were stocking up on the protective facial gear in case they become harder to find in New York, Luckman said.

The face masks were also flying off the shelves at the Falk Surgical supply shop on the Upper East Side, a rep from the store said.

“Were about to sell out,” he said, before declining to elaborate. “I can’t tell you they are selling a lot.”

He said the store plans to get more masks by Monday — if they’re still in stock with wholesale providers.

The virus, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China, had killed at least 26 people Friday.
