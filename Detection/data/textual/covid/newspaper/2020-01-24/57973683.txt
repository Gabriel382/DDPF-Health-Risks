SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore confirmed two more cases of a new strain of coronavirus, its health ministry said on Friday, a day after  identifying its first case of the infection that originated from China. 
The ministry said it expected more imported cases because of high travel volume from China, where the virus has killed 25 people and infected more than 800. Singaporeâ€™s tally of confirmed cases is now three.
