Stock market live updates: Futures rise, American Express gains on earnings, Intel leads chipmakers 
 U.S. stock futures are trading higher to end a choppy week of trading. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up about 85 points, indicating a gain of around 95 points at the open. American Express rose more than 2% to lead the gains on the back of better-than-expected earnings. Intel shares also got a boost from strong earnings. But the Dow was still on pace to post its first weekly loss of the year as worries over the deadly coronavirus subdued market sentiment. Those fears started to ease Thursday after the World Health Organization stopped short of declaring the virus spread a worldwide health emergency. â€”Imbert
