Wuhan virus: ICA to implement temperature screening at Tuas, Woodlands checkpoints 
 SINGAPORE – Temperature screening will be implemented at Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints from noon on Friday (24 January).

In a statement, Singapore’s Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said “this is in response to the novel coronavirus pneumonia development in Wuhan and exported cases to other cities and countries”. The ICA also anticipates an increase in travel volume in the lead up to the Chinese New Year holiday period.

Travellers arriving at the land checkpoints will have to undergo temperature screening conducted by on-site healthcare assistants. Suspect cases will be referred to hospitals for further assessment.

Here’s how it will be done for people travelling on the different modes of transport:

By bus: Travellers will be screened at the alighting bus concourse or bus hall before immigration counters. Bus drivers will be screened at the security check area. By train: Travellers will be screened at the alighting platform before entering the train hall for immigration clearance. By car: Travellers are required to wind down their car windows for temperature screening at the security check area before immigration counters. By motorcycle: Travellers are required to remove their helmets for temperature screening at the security check area after immigration counters. By lorry: Travellers will be screened at the cargo platforms or immigration counters.
