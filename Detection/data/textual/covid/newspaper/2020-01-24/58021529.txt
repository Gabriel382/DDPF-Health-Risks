Where has coronavirus spread to - Which countries have confirmed cases? 
 14 people have now been tested for coronavirus in the UK so far as a precaution and airports are screening passengers travelling from the virus’ source in Wuhan, China as efforts to contain the flu-like virus intensify.

No one in the UK has been confirmed as having contracted the virus so far, but the Health Secretary has said that there is an ‘increased likelihood’ of cases occurring as the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan rises.

The World Health Organisation has not declared the outbreak a global emergency but Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that the NHS is ‘ready to respond appropriately’ if there are confirmed cases in the UK.

In China, where a new facility is currently being built in Wuhan in just 10 days specifically for coronavirus patients, the death toll has risen to 25 and there have been 830 cases of the virus confirmed.

The outbreak of coronavirus is suspected to have come from animals sold at a food market in Wuhan.

The majority of reported coronavirus cases of the coronavirus have been in and around Wuhan, however there are now other confirmed cases elsewhere in the world.

There have been reports of the virus in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, the United States, Thailand and Vietnam.

A second confirmed case of the virus was reported in Japan this morning and a fifth case has been confirmed in Thailand, with the patient being a woman in her 30s from Wuhan visiting the country for a holiday.

A new blog on the website of Public Health England describes the typical symptoms of coronavirus as including: ‘fever and a cough that may progress to a severe pneumonia causing shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.’

It also states: ‘we currently consider the risk to the UK population to be low.’
