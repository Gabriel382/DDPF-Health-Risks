China building thousand bed hospital over the weekend for coronavirus 
 The Chinese city of Wuhan is constructing a hospital with one thousand beds over the weekend, as the city and the country continue to try and stem the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus, Reuters reports.

According to the Changjiang Daily, the prefabricated medical building is being built by a lake on the outskirts of the city and officials hope to have it up and running by early next week.

Coronavirus has killed 25 people in China and infected more than 800, the Chinese government reported on Friday.

China has increased measures to contain the virus, suspending public transport and shutting down several temples and major destinations over the Lunar New Year.

The World Health Organization has declared it an emergency but has yet to declare it an international epidemic.

Wuhan hopes to copy the game plan used by Beijing in 2003 when it built a hospital in a week to try and contain an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
