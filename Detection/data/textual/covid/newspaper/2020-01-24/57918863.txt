Binay, Villanueva seek Senate probe on coronavirus 
 MANILA, Philippines – Senators Nnacy Binay and Joel Villanueva have sought an inquiry on the coronavirus scare gripping the world as well as the government’s preparedness in addressing the matter.

The new virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, has reportedly killed at least 17 people while over 500 confirmed cases had also been recorded in several countries.

Binay sought the probe through Senate  Resolution No. 293,  which she said was aimed at determining appropriate measures and necessary funding requirements “to ensure a quick and efficient government response” in case the virus spreads in the country.

“There is a need to determine an emergency response plan in case the outbreak reached Philippine shores and ensure that the Philippine government and its instrumentalities are fully equipped to address the same,”  Binay said in the resolution.

Villanueva, meanwhile, filed Senate Resolution No. 291  to find out the government’s preparedness on the “detection, prevention, minimization, treatments, and containment measures” on the new virus.

“Whereas, measures that must immediately be crafted include stricter health control and screenings at airports and seaports, especially considering the growing number of Chinese tourists and workers in the Philippines,” Villanueva said in the resolution.

He added that in the first eight months of 2018 alone, over 1.2 million Chinese tourists visited the Philippines, 20 percent more than in 2017.
