135 Chinese tourists from Wuhan to return home: aviation official 
 MANILA - All 135 tourists from Wuhan province in China who arrived in Kalibo, Aklan on Thursday will be returned to their point of origin, an aviation official said Friday, as more countries record cases of the mysterious new coronavirus.

Philippine carriers Royal Air Charter and Pan Pacific Airline will launch 4 flights to take the tourists back to Wuhan, according to Wyrlou Samodio, chief of Civil Aeronautics Board's legal division.

Samodio did not give details about the schedule of the flights.

The passengers arrived in Aklan before the Philippines announced that it was halting flights to and from the central Chinese city where the virus originated.

Health officials earlier cleared from the illness 3 Chinese tourists with influenza-like symptoms who arrived in Kalibo. A flight attendant also placed herself in "self-quarantine" after exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus.

A child from Nanjing, China who arrived in Aklan with fever, meanwhile, is under observation, according to the provincial health officer.

China has locked down Wuhan, home to 11 million people, following the outbreak of the new strain of virus which has so far claimed at least 18 lives since its emergence last month.

The illness has been reported in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong and reached other countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the US.

The Philippines has reported a suspected case of the new virus after a 5-year-old from Wuhan arrived in Cebu City and tested positive for a non-specific coronavirus.

Specimen from the patient was sent to specialists in Australia to identify which coronavirus strain he carried. Results are expected to be released on Saturday, Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo told ABS-CBN News.
