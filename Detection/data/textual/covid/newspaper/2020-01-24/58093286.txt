The fatal flu-like coronavirus spreading quickly throughout Asia has now killed at least 26 people and sickened more than 900 worldwide, including two patients in the U.S.

The majority of the reported cases are in mainland China, where local authorities have quarantined several major cities and canceled Lunar New Year's events in Beijing and elsewhere. Multiple cases of the virus have been confirmed in Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Japan and the United States. Taiwan has confirmed one case.

U.S. health officials diagnosed the nation's second patient with the virus after a Chicago woman returned from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. There are 63 other potential cases in the U.S. that are currently being monitored, they said.

Travel bans were in effect Friday for at least 10 Chinese cities, including Wuhan, where the virus emerged Dec. 31. China said Thursday it was offering to refund domestic flights and train tickets nationwide.
