Officials confirm second US case of coronavirus 
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday confirmed a second U.S. case of coronavirus, in Chicago.

The person is a woman in her 60s who recently returned from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak.

Officials said there are 63 cases in 22 states that are under investigation for coronavirus and being tested, but only two have tested positive at this point.

Dr. Nancy Messionier of the CDC said the virus is a "very serious public health threat," but added: "The immediate risk to the U.S. public is low at this time but the situation continues to evolve rapidly."

The patient in Chicago is in isolation in a hospital and is in stable condition, officials said.

She was not symptomatic while traveling and has not had extended close contact with others since getting sick, officials said, which they believe are good signs for preventing the disease from spreading from her.
