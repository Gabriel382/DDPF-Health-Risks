ASX 200 opens stronger after contagion fears 
 Sky News Business reporter Edward Boyd says the ASX opened higher on Friday morning, "brushing off some of the global concerns around the coronavirus". Mr Boyd said "the virus has really dominated new cycles over the last few days", affecting shares around the world in Hong Kong and China in particular. The Australian ASX 200 was up almost 0.4 per cent on Friday morning. Image: AP
