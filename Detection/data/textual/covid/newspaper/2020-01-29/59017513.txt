Oil prices rise on surprise crude draw 
 The American Petroleum Institute (API) estimated on Tuesday a surprise large crude oil inventory draw of 4.27 million barrels for the week ending January 24, compared to analyst expectations of a 482,000-barrel build in inventory.

    
Last week saw a build in crude oil inventories of 1.57 million barrels, according to API data. The EIA’s estimates, however, were of a draw of 400,000 barrels for that week.
Oil prices were up earlier in the day prior to the afternoon data release, ending a five day price slide as fears of oil demand destruction at the hands of the deadly Coronavirus gripped the oil markets. Even with Libya’s near-complete production shutdown of nearly 1 million barrels per day, oil prices were still down week over week.

At 3:43 pm EST on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading up $0.46 (+0.87%) at $53.60 - roughly down $5 per barrel under last week’s levels. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading up slightly on Tuesday, by $0.33 (+0.56%), at $58.91 - off more than $6 per barrel compared to last week’s prices.
The API this week also reported a build of 3.27 million barrels of gasoline for week ending January 24, after last week’s large 4.5-million-barrel build. This week’s large gasoline build compares to analyst expectations of a 1.32-million barrel-build for the week.
