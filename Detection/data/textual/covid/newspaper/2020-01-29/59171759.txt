Coronavirus Outbreak Prompts China to Postpone Indoor World Athletics Championships 
 The World Athletics said Wednesday that it had postponed the Indoor World Championships slated for March in Nanjing, China, until 2021, over concerns that athletes could be put at risk by competing in virus-hit China.

The WHO said earlier on Wednesday that it would soon introduce a global health emergency due to the continued spread of the infection.

China's Wuhan is ground zero for the latest strain of the deadly coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, which has prompted authorities around the globe to impose special screenings at airports for flu- and pneumonia-like symptoms, particularly for passengers arriving from this, and other, Chinese cities.
