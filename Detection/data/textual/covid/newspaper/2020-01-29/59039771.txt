Morrison's coronavirus plan 'makes perfect sense' 
 Sky News host Paul Murray says recent announcements made by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on the deadly coronavirus "make perfect sense". Mr Morrison had said the government is preparing to evacuate Australians currently in Wuhan where the deadly coronavirus is believed to have originated. He said the operation - to be carried out in cooperation with the New Zealand government - would target "isolated and vulnerable" Australians. The prime minister said the government was establishing a quarantine zone on Christmas Island in preparation for the evacuees. He said they would remain there, where they would undergo testing, for an estimated 14 days. "One of the great advantages of Australia is that we are an island," Mr Murray said. "This is what you can do when you are an island". Image: Getty
