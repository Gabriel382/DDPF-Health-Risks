Coronavirus outbreak: Canada working to return some citizens from China 
 The Canadian government has received requests for consular assistance from more than 100 citizens in China amid fears of the spread of a new coronavirus says Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.



But he added officials have not yet determined whether to evacuate them.



In a scrum with reporters on Tuesday, Champagne said there are 250 Canadian citizens who have registered with Global Affairs Canada as being in China and that of those, 106 have requested aid in getting out as the new virus continues to spread.



“We’re trying to assess their specific needs for repatriation,” he said, noting it is currently the middle of the night in China which is complicating those efforts.



“We’re looking at all options to assist them. I’ll come back to you when I have more.”



The U.S., France and other countries are preparing to evacuate their citizens from Chinese cities hit by the coronavirus.



But Canada has not yet announced plans to follow suit.
