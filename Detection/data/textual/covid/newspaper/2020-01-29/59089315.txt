Foxconn promises iPhone supply wont be affected by coronavirus 
 Yesterday we heard that the production of iPhones could be hampered due to the coronavirus situation and the practical shutdown of the Hubei province in China. Today, Foxconn, one of AppleÂs key partners, issued a press release, assuring there are measures to continue meeting global manufacturing obligations.




Foxconn has a massive plant in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak, but the facility is following holiday schedules and people will not return to work until all businesses have resumed standard operating hours.


Currently, people are still celebrating the Lunar New Year, which was extended to February 2 by the government to contain the spread of the virus.


Due to the uncertainty coming from China and the epidemy, Apple reported a wider-than-usual earnings outlook. Tim Cook told Reuters that Âthe situation is emerging, and weÂre still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closelyÂ.
