 Man Diagnosed with Wuhan Coronavirus Is Being Treated Largely by a Robot

The first person diagnosed with the Wuhan coronavirus in the U.S. is being treated with the help of a robot at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, WA.

The robot is equipped with a stethoscope to help doctors take the man's vital signs; it communicates with him via a large screen.

"The nursing staff in the room move the robot around so we can see the patient in the screen, talk to him," said the medical centerâ€™s Dr. George Diaz, adding that the use of the robot minimizes exposure of medical staff to the infected man, who remains in isolation.
