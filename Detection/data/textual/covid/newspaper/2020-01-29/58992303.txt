Chinese soccer team quarantined in Qld 
 The Chinese women's national football team is in isolation in Brisbane after arriving on Wednesday morning.

The team were in the city of Wuhan on January 22, and will be required to stay at their inner-city hotel until February 5 over fears that members may have the deadly coronavirus.

The 32 players, coaches and staff arrived in Brisbane on a flight from Shanghai, but new regulations force them to be isolated until February 5.

Queensland health minister Steven Miles confirmed the hotel was in the centre of Brisbane.

New state government requirements demand residents to self-isolate for 14 days from when they left Wuhan, says chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young.

"Anyone who has been in contact with a confirmed case must self-isolate in their homes," she said.

Dr Young said the football team posed no risk to the Queensland community.

A further 19 people in the state were tested for coronavirus.
