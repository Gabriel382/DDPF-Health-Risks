'Death Angel' is Here? 'God is About to Purge a Lot of Sin', Pastor Claims Amid Coronavirus Outbreak 
 As doctors and researchers struggle to contain the deadly outbreak of a new coronavirus which emerged in China’s Wuhan in December 2019, one Christian pastor from the United States has recently suggested that the pathogen might be related to the divine.

According to Right Wing Watch, Rick Wiles, a senior pastor at the non-denominational Flowing Streams Church in Florida and creator of the TruNews streaming channel, appeared to suggest that the outbreak may be a plague sent by the Almighty.

​Arguing that "plagues are one of the last steps of judgement", Wiles then described China as a "godless state" led by a "godless communist government that persecutes Christians", before making some unflattering remarks about the US as well.

Wiles also said that "the Death Angel may be moving right now across the planet", and suggested that this is the time for the people to "get right with God".

A number of social media users, however, did not seem thrilled by the pastor’s musings, with some noting that Wiles apparently said similar things about the Ebola virus before.
