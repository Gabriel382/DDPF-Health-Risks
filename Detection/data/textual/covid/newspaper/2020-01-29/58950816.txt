 Japan confirms virus in man who had not been to China

TOKYO (AFP) - Japanese authorities said Tuesday a man with no recent travel to China has contracted the novel strain of coronavirus -- apparently after driving tourists from Wuhan, where a deadly outbreak began.

The man in his sixties from Nara drove two groups of tourists from Wuhan earlier in January and was hospitalised on Saturday with flu-like symptoms, the health ministry said.
