 Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.50% announced Wednesday that it has initiated development of a vaccine against the new coronavirus, 2019nCoV, as part of its "multi-pronged" response to the outbreak of the deadly virus.

J&J said it will also review known pathways in coronavirus pathophysiology to determine whether previously tested medicines can be used to reduce the severity of 2019-nCoV. "We are collaborating with regulators, healthcare organizations, institutions and communities worldwide to help ensure our research platforms, existing science and outbreak expertise can be maximized to stem this public health threat," said J&J's Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels.
