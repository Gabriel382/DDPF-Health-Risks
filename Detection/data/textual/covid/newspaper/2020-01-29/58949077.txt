Korea��s consumer sentiment at 17-month high in Jan before coronavirus outbreak 
 South Korea��s consumer sentiment in January hit the highest in 17 months on expectations of better economic and income prospects from eased trade tensions. But whether the momentum will last remains to be seen due to the outbreak of a deadly new coronavirus in China. 
The composite consumer sentiment index gained 3.7 points from the previous month to reach 104.2 in January, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said Wednesday. It is the highest reading since 105.6 in June 2018.
An index reading of above 100 means more people believe the economy to be better compared with the 2003-2019 reference period, while a reading below 100 means there are more pessimists.
The index had turned north from last September and briefly exceeded the 100 threshold in November before edging down in December. 
                    
 The signing of the U.S.-China trade agreement in January buoyed economic indicators and improved financial expectations of households, lifting the overall consumer sentiment, explained Kwon Cheo-yoon, a BOK official. 
The index tracking sentiment of current economic conditions compared with the previous six months rose 4 points to 78. The index measuring future economic prospects six months from now also jumped 5 points to 87. 
Households were more optimistic about their future livelihood and income, with the index for both figures up 3 points and 2 points, respectively, to 97 and 101.

 The index measuring expectations on future home prices dropped 9 points to 116, following the government��s toughened measures to cool the overheated property market. 
Consumers saw inflation over the past year to be 1.8 percent, unchanged from the previous month. Inflation prospects for the next year inched up 0.1 percentage point to 1.8 percent.
