PRESS CONFERENCE: Health Minister on mitigating coronavirus risk 
 Travellers returning home from the Hubei province of China will be asked to remain in an at-home isolation for a two-week period, as the Australian government works to mitigate the risk of the spreading of the coronavirus. Health Minister Greg Hunt and Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy announced the new advice in relation to the quarantine rules over the potentially deadly disease after a meeting Health Protection Principal Committee. It came as new evidence suggested asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection can occur and the pre-symptomatic transmission has occurred in one case in Germany. Image: Getty
