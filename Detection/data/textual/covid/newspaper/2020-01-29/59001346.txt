Apple CEO Says Company Limiting Employees' Trips to China Due to Coronavirus Outbreak 
 Cook also said that some Apple suppliers are located in Wuhan and at least several company's branches in the country would be closed until 10 February, at the recommendation of the Chinese government.

He added that given that most of the Apple manufacturing facilities are located in China, the outbreak will affect the company's sales.

The previously unknown type of the virus was first detected in December and has since killed over 130 people and infected almost 6,000 others, according to China's National Health Commission. Despite efforts to contain the disease, cases have already been reported in Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United States, Vietnam, Taiwan, Sri Lanka and Cambodia.
