 German flagship airline Lufthansa announced on Wednesday that it would suspend all flights to and from mainland China until February 9, as the number of deaths from a coronavirus outbreak rose to 132.

The disease has infected around 6,000 people so far, most of them in the central Chinese province of Hubei. Dozens of cases have also been reported in more than 10 other countries.

Lufthansa's decision also affects flights run by its subsidiaries Swiss and Austrian Airlines.
