Coronavirus-fearing people wear plastic bottles on heads amid mask shortage 
 People have gone to extreme measures to avoid getting the coronavirus - by putting plastic bottles over their heads.

Yep, you read that correctly. The bizarre preventative action was spotted when a person was photographed at Vancouver International Airport wearing the plastic headwear.

In an image from the back, it appears that the person has cut a hole into the container in order to make room for their ponytail.

Others have also been spotted wearing face masks and plastic bottles on their heads, which have the lids removed to ensure the wearers still get their oxygen.

Over 16 countries have been affected by the disease which has taken the lives of 130 people in mainland China.

The viral infection is yet to reach British shores but if it does, you'll now know just what to do to help save yourself.

Lynne Carter posted the images to Facebook at roughly 2 p.m. on Jan. 28, captioning, "Fresh out of YVR. The latest anti-virus shields made with old water jugs."

Carter also included a third photo of an adult with a child who are both wearing bottles on their heads.

The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention does not advise wearing containers on your head to prevent a coronavirus infection.

Any Brits returning from coronavirus-hit Wuhan will be held at an army base, government sources have said.

This comes after British Airways suspended all flights to and from mainland China in response to the outbreak, which originated in Wuhan.

Survivalists in the UK have now begun prepping for a coronavirus outbreak as China confirmed over 6,000 cases of the deadly disease.

Worryingly, people seem to think Coronavirus is linked to Corona beerâ€“ with searches searches for "beer virus" spiking since China's deadly outbreak.
