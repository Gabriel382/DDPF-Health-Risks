Hundreds of foreigners evacuated from China coronavirus epicentre 
 Hundreds of people from Japan and the United States are returning home after being evacuated from China's Hubei province.

The region is at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak which has so far left more than 130 people dead, and nearly 6,000 others infected.

The evacuations come as some commercial airlines have reduced the number of flights to China, or stopped flying there altogether.
