Novel Coronavirus 
 Recently, an outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus in China has caused global concern. It came from a seafood and meat market in Wuhan, China, in December. It has since spread to other countries, including the United States. The market sold live and recently killed animals, which is where the virus originated.

Six cities in China have been quarantined because of the coronavirus. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the risk to the American public is low at this time.
