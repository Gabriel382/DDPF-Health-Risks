In its latest numbers released Tuesday, WHO said 4,593 cases have been identified worldwide.

Overall, 56 people in 14 countries have been diagnosed with the virus, according to the WHO.

Last week, the WHO postponed declaring novel coronavirus a global public health emergency. At the time, Director-General Tedros Adhanom said more information was needed before health officials could issue such a call.
