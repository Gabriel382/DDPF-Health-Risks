Brits returning from China will be quarantined 'at military base' for two weeks 
 British people returning to the UK from China will be put in quarantine for two weeks.

It comes as British Airways has suspended all its flights to and from mainland China because of fears over the spread of coronavirus.

Australia, Japan, the US and countries in Europe are also repatriating their citizens after the deaths of more than 100 people.

So far, the virus has spread from the central city of Wuhan across China and to at least 16 other countries.

The government plans to fly 200 Britons out of the epicentre on Thursday.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has instructed officials to put them in quarantine for two weeks – likely to be at a military base.

According to the BBC, they will be given the best possible medical care and advice while being kept there.

Australia has announced its own plans to quarantine its 600 returning citizens for two weeks on Christmas Island – some 1,200 miles from the mainland.
