First Fed meeting of the decade 
 Economists aren't expecting a change in the Fed's key rate range of 1.5% to 1.75% at a policy meeting today, but Chairman Jerome Powell could signal tweaks to the central bank's repo program.

In an effort to stabilize overnight and short-term lending market rates, it has been conducting about $60B per month in bond purchase.

The Fed might also discuss how global growth and the coronavirus outbreak may influence future rate decisions, as well as hints of any operational changes.
