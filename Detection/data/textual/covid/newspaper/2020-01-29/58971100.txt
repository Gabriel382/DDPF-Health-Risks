Aust-grown coronavirus: why it's important 
 WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN MELBOURNE?

*Scientists from Melbourne's Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity have grown the coronavirus from a patient sample.

*Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV is growing in Vero E6 cells.

*It's the first time the virus has been grown in cell culture outside of China.

WHAT WILL IT DO?

* Give expert international laboratories information to help combat the virus and improve testing.

* It may be used to create an antibody test to detect the virus in patients who haven't displayed symptoms and unaware they have it.

WHERE DID THE SAMPLE COME FROM?

* "It was a patient in Australia. It was our first diagnosis." Doherty Institute deputy director Mike Catton

HOW WAS THE VIRUS GROWN?

* The virus was grown from a patient sample which came to the Royal Melbourne Hospital's Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at the Doherty Institute on Friday, January 24.

WHAT IS THE PROCESS TO GROW A VIRUS?

* "It's an old school technique. The current diagnostics are very rapid and fast. The old-school techniques you have or rely on cell lines, or cell sheets that grow in a single layer of cells on a flask. You inoculate or place some patient material onto those cells, and you hope the virus in the sample gets into the cells, infects the cells and then will produce a pattern in the cells that demonstrates the cells are dying. That is what we see. The cells actually die in the progression of infection. So that's how we know the virus is happening.

"We've used the same test on that material on patients to assess that level of virus . .. so we know the amount of virus going up is present so we can prove the virus is growing."

WHY HAS THIS LAB BEEN ABLE TO GROW THE VIRUS WHEN OTHERS CAN'T?

* "The unique position that we still maintain the old, traditional styles of culture which are very limited in resources in most labs. Most labs do not have that capacity. And to have a bank of cell lines accessible ... we are well placed for that approach. It just means we have got those two pieces of that puzzle in the one laboratory which makes us unique."

* Share the virus with local health organisations, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, run by the CSIRO, in Victoria and possibly researchers in Queensland to develop a vaccine.

* Work with labs and the World Health Organisation.
