Meanwhile, the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) is taking stern measures to curb the spread of fake news regarding the virus.

It released a statement that it had detained a 34-year-old man in Bangi yesterday (Jan 28) with the assistance of police for allegedly spreading fake news.

The case is being investigated under Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 which carries a maximum fine of RM50,000 (S$17,000), not more than a year of imprisonment, or both upon conviction.

"Such a stern action is taken to ensure that fake news about the virus is not spread by irresponsible individuals that could disrupt public order," the regulatory body said.
