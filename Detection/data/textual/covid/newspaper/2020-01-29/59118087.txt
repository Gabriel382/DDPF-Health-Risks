Wuhan virus: Lufthansa scraps all China flights 
 FRANKFURT AM MAIN (AFP) - Germany's flagship carrier Lufthansa said on Wednesday (Jan 29) it was cancelling all its mainland China flights over the deadly coronavirus until Feb 9, including those run by subsidiaries Swiss and Austrian Airlines.

Each of the carriers will fly to their respective destinations in China "one last time" to give passengers and crew "the opportunity to return to Germany, Switzerland and Austria", the Lufthansa group - one of Europe's largest airline companies - said in a statement.
