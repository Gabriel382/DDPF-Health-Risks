Coronavirus testing ramping up in NSW 
 There have been more than 40 people in NSW tested for the deadly coronavirus infection

Coronavirus testing is ramping up in NSW as authorities await laboratory results for 16 new possible cases referred for investigation.

NSW chief medical officer Kerry Chant urged recent visitors to the Chinese province of Hubei - the epicentre of the viral outbreak - to come forward.

"We want to get the message out that people with low-level symptoms need to come forward," she said.

"We want to detect those cases and it will help us to better understand the disease."

Dr Chant on Wednesday afternoon confirmed 16 possible coronavirus cases were being investigated in NSW, including a two-year-old child.

Two people confirmed to be infected in NSW have improved significantly and could soon be released from hospital isolation, Dr Chant added.

There have been more than 40 people tested for the infection in NSW.

The NSW government is urging parents to keep their children home from school if they have travelled to China in the past 14 days.

The federal government on Wednesday afternoon changed its coronavirus containment advice after an earlier disagreement with NSW and Western Australia.

Anyone in Australia who has been to China's Hubei province should now isolate themselves at home for 14 days after the visit, Health Minister Greg Hunt said.

There are now seven confirmed cases of the virus in Australia, including four in NSW, two in Victoria and one in Queensland.

Australians trapped in the Chinese city of Wuhan due to the viral outbreak will be evacuated to Christmas Island.
