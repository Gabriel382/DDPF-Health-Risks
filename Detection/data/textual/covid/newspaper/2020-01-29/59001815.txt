Bank stocks lift European shares 
 Jan 29 (Reuters) - European shares gained slightly on Wednesday, helped by bank stocks following strong results from Santander, but mounting concerns about the fast-spreading coronavirus kept a lid on gains.

By 0809 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.1%, continuing a recovery from a selloff earlier this week.

Spain's IBEX outperformed regional bourses, lifted by a 2% rise in Santander. The lender posted a higher quarterly net profit, boosted by a solid underlying performance in its main market Brazil and capital gains.

The banks index climbed 0.5%, the most among the main European subsectors.
