Coronavirus: Britons to be evacuated from Wuhan 
 Britons are due to be evacuated from Wuhan in China over growing fears the coronavirus could spread.



Around 200 Britons are waiting to be airlifted from the Chinese province, with hopes of a flight back tomorrow. 



Government sources said the group will be quarantined in a secure facility - potentially a military base - for two weeks, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms or not.

British Airways has suspended all direct flights to China after the Government urged Britons not to travel to the country in response to coronavirus. 



All flights have been suspended until 3 February, with the airline's website showing no direct flights to either Shanghai or Beijing available until March. A spokesperson for British Airways said the airline is "urgently assessing the situation".
