Death threat as Manchester United vice-chairman's house attacked 
 Cheshire Police have launched an investigation into an attack on the home of Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward.

Manchester United condemned what the club called an "unwarranted attack'' by vandals on the home of its executive vice chairman, Ed Woodward.

Footage posted on social media showed red flares being thrown over the gates of Woodward's property. A message at the bottom of the video read: "Ed Woodward's gonna die.''

United said it had been made aware of the incident "outside the home of one of our employees", adding that the "football world will unite behind us'' as the club works with police to identify the vandals.

"Anybody found guilty of a criminal offence, or found to be trespassing on this property, will be banned for life by the club,'' the club said in a statement.

"Fans expressing opinion is one thing, criminal damage and intent to endanger life and property is another. There is simply no excuse for this.''

It was unclear whether Woodward was inside the property during the attack.

Woodward and United's owners, the US-based Glazer family, have been the targets of verbal abuse from fans at the last two United matches.

United, which is the record 20-time champion of England, hasn't won the Premier League since 2013 and is struggling to seriously challenge for big trophies.

United is in fifth place in the league, 33 points behind leader and fierce rival Liverpool.

Woodward, who is married with two young children, has been blamed for United's recent troubles because he effectively runs the club's day-to-day operation and oversees recruitment.
