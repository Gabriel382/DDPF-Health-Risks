2 OFWs from Wuhan arrive in PH; now under ‘self-quarantine’ — BOQ 
 MANILA, Philippines — Two Filipinos from Wuhan, China, where the novel coronavirus has originated, have arrived in the Philippines and are now undertaking self-quarantine, the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) said Wednesday.

In a press briefing in Quezon City, Quarantine bureau chief Ferdinand Salcedo said the two Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), who arrived on Tuesday night, are being monitored by a surveillance officer.

“We have two OFWs from Wuhan, so far, they are being monitored by our surveillance officer. They are staying somewhere they are being monitored once or twice a day,” Salcedo said.

Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo noted that the Filipino workers are staying inside a condominium, noting that the OFWs are also being monitored by the Department of Health (DOH).

On Tuesday, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said Filipinos from China can voluntarily return to the Philippines but will be placed under quarantine for 14 days.

Is the repatriation of Filipinos risky?

Asked if repatriation of Filipinos in China is a “risk,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said it is the government’s decision to assist Filipinos to return home, noting their strict policy for a quarantine period.

“We are already committed to facilitating the repatriation or voluntary return of our people based in Wuhan but with clear conditionality that they are subjected to quarantine period of about 14 days,” he said.

A report from DFA showed that 50 Filipinos from Wuhan and Hubei provinces requested repatriation amid the outbreak of nCoV in China.

Recent reports said there are more than 6,000 cases of confirmed 2019-nCoV in China. Meanwhile, the death toll due to the new virus in China is now at 132.
