Sales of face masks, hand sanitizer soar amid coronavirus fears - Bizwomen 
 Amid the global spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, face mask manufacturers are increasing production to meet demand as even some U.S. stores sell out.

In China, where the outbreak originated last month, demand for hygiene-related items like face masks, hand sanitizer, rubber gloves, protective goggles and thermometers has skyrocketed, and it’s having a ripple effect throughout the world.

Axios reports drug stores in New York City and Chicago, and some in California, are selling out of the masks as the coronavirus spreads. Companies that make rubber gloves have seen shares shoot up; sellers on eBay, mentioning coronavirus, are listing respirator masks, air purifiers and disposable, fluid-resistant jackets, reports MarketWatch.

One analyst projects L Brands’ Bath & Body Works — which saw sales grow during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 — could see sales of hand soap and hand sanitizer jump amid this outbreak, reports CNBC.

Soaps and hand sanitizers are responsible for about one-fifth of L Brands’ overall sales, and if greater demand increases sales, it could add 2 to 4 percent to the company’s overall same-store sales growth, per CNBC.

Currently, five Americans have been diagnosed with coronavirus, and public health officials say U.S. residents do not need to wear face masks. The sales spike in the U.S. could be due to masks being mailed back to China, as one pharmacist told the New York Post.

Wuhan, China is the epicenter of the outbreak, which has since spread to the U.S., Canada, Japan, Thailand, Australia, South Korea, France, Germany and several other countries, reports The New York Times. In China, where more than 100 people have died from the virus, residents face travel restrictions and have been encouraged to cover their mouths and noses with face masks.
