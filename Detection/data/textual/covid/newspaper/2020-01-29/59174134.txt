Coronavirus won't hurt meat sales to China: JBS CEO 
 SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The chief executive of Brazilian meatpacker JBS SA said on Wednesday that he does not expect the coronavirus outbreak to negatively impact China’s meat imports. 
CEO Gilberto Tomazoni said that during China’s SARS outbreak in the 2000s, which could be a comparable situation, meat imports actually rose.
