Hand cleansing at Heathrow and nine other hub airports could slash virus spread by 40% 
 Improving hand cleansing facilities at London Heathrow and nine other major global airports could reduce the spread of the respiratory epidemics by almost 40 per cent, experts have said.

In a study published just days before China’s deadly coronavirus was first identified, researchers found that ramping up awareness of – and access to – handwashing facilities at 10 of the world’s most “influential” airports could reduce the spread of a respiratory pandemic by 37 per cent.

This figure could be as high as 69 per cent if applied to all airports worldwide.

Dr Christos Nicolaides, lead author of the report and professor at the University of Cyprus, said significant lessons from the study could be applied to the current fast-growing coronavirus outbreak.

The new disease has so far claimed more than 100 lives and infected some 4,500 people in China and 15 other countries – including the US, France and Australia.
