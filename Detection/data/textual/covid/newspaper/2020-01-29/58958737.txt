Osaka Pref. to release info on local coronavirus infections even if Japan gov't won't 
 OSAKA -- The Osaka Prefectural Government decided on Jan. 28 that in the event a person infected with the new coronavirus is confirmed to have been in Osaka Prefecture, it will release details of the individual's arrival in Japan, period of stay and which municipalities they were in, even if the national government does not.

The western Japan prefectural government is also looking into whether it can release more detailed information on the areas the infected person was staying in cases where the risk of infection is deemed high, such as when the person did not wear a facemask during their stay. Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura said, "It's important for us to provide information that helps prefectural residents plan to protect themselves."

On the subject of the tour bus driver and resident of nearby Nara Prefecture who was infected with the virus despite having never been to Wuhan in China, Yoshimura made clear his demands to see more details of infected people's travel history in Japan.

"The national government must publicize the facts," he told reporters.

The Osaka Prefectural Government is also set to open a helpline from Jan. 29 for prefectural residents who have recently travelled to Wuhan, and who have symptoms such as fever. The number is 06-6944-8197.
