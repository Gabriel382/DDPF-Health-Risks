China's state broadcaster to cancel Oscars Red Carpet coverage; Read details - Times of India 
 With the date of 92nd 
Academy Awards coming close, fans have been sharing their excitement on social media. But according to latest reports making rounds online, China's state broadcaster is all set to cancel the 
Oscars Red Carpet coverage.


The step has been taken in response to the worsening 
coronavirus crisis that has become a concern to the entire world. The reporters and the entire team won't be leaving home to cover the Oscars this year. Meanwhile, the report further suggests that the plans might even change but it completely depends on how the coronavirus outbreak improves.


While most of the people in China are staying at home and avoiding public spaces in fear of the coronavirus, media regulators have been focussing on making way for more new related coverage due to which the 
entertainment coverage has been affected. 


Many public areas including cinemas in Shanghai, the city's Disneyland resort and even Beijing's Forbidden City have been shut due to concerns about the virus. China's biggest Chinese New Year films have also been pulled as nearly the entire entertainment industry has come to a halt. Many even believe the epidemic could affect the global box office collections as many industries have already suffered huge financial blows.


With China termed as the second most important territory for films in the world, the curtailing of Oscars red carpet is sure to have a huge impact. Not only that but even the Oscar-nominated films like '
Jojo Rabbit', 'Little Women', 'Marriage Story' and '1917' which are scheduled to release in China in February to seem to be looming in dark at the moment.
