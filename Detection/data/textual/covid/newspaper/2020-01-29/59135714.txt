Coronavirus outbreak: Travelers cover heads with plastic bottles to dodge disease 
 Desperate times call for desperate measures for travelers trying to ward off the deadly coronavirus – with some covering their heads with plastic bottles, according to a report.

Images have emerged of airline passengers wearing jugs as makeshift space helmets, among other improvised items, to protect themselves as the death toll from the virus has reached 132 and more than 6,000 have been infected, the UK’s Sun reported.

A family was seen covered in plastic sheets at an airport terminal, while a man was pictured wearing a motorcycle helmet on a flight from Shanghai to Perth, Australia.

Passengers on the China Eastern flight told The West Australian that most of the people aboard were wearing face masks as a minimum and that the airliner was sprayed after its arrival.

A woman and her child also were spotted strolling through Hong Kong’s Metro system while wearing oversized plastic jugs on their heads.

In China, people have been warned that they’d be banned from public transportation if they did not wear face masks, the Sun reported.
