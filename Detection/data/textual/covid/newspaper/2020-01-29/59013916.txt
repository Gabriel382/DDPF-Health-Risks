Some S. Korean Cruise Ships Suspend Passenger Services to and From China 
 Some of the South Korean ferries sailing to and from China will stop passenger services as part of enhanced efforts to contain the spread of the new coronavirus that began in China. 


According to the Incheon Port Authority and related local industries, three cruise operators specialized on the Incheon-China route will suspend passenger services from Wednesday for the time being. 


However, the transportation of containers by the operators will still continue. 


An official at one of the companies said the measure was taken to help combat the respiratory disease, adding that they will wait until next Tuesday to decide whether or not to resume passenger services.
