 PATIALA: Punjab Police’s wait to bring back Ramanjit Singh ‘Romi’ , the prime accused in the Nabha jailbreak incident has got longer as the Hong Kong government has asked its population to work from home and suspended the working in a number of departments including the justice department.Last month, the key conspirator of the Nabha Jailbreak-Ramanjit Singh ‘Romi’ had filed a second appeal in the higher court in Hong Kong challenging his extradition to India after the Eastern Court had dismissed his plea challenging his extradition to India on the grounds that he was being targeted for being a pro-Khalistan and claimed he was ‘at risk of brutal treatment if returned to the country of his birth.’The higher court while admitting his second plea had called for a day to day based hearing which had started early this month. The Punjab police had been expecting that the hearing would be completed soon and they will be able to secure his custody.However, the Hong Kong government on Monday directed the population to stay inside their as attempts are being made to stop the virus spreading after six confirmed cases were detected there. The government asked the civil servants to work from home for one week, while sports facilities and museums have been shut down indefinitely.AIG GS Chauhan, who had been pursuing his extradition case right from the beginning, said he had just been informed about the suspension of work in the justice department. He said this might delay the completion of hearing in the case.The Indian Authorities are closing following the legal proceedings and as and when the Hong Kong Justice will decide to send Romi back to India, a team of Punjab police will secure the Romi’s custody.In India, Romi faces multiple charges ranging from conspiring to break jail, funding terror modules, credit card fraud and setting up an arms base to spread terror like activities in Punjab besides being involved in the Punjab targeted killings and has been lodged at Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre (prison) after being detained by the Hong Kong Police in February 2018.
