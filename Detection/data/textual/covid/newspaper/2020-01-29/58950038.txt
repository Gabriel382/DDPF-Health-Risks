GRAINS-Soybeans tick up, gains capped by concerns over Chinese demand 
 SINGAPORE, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Chicago soybean futures edged higher on Wednesday as the market took a breather after dropping to a more than one-month low earlier this week, although gains were capped by concerns over China's demand.

Corn rose for a second session, while wheat prices gained after finishing lower the last three days.

* The most-active Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soybean contract added 0.8% to $9.01-3/4 a bushel by 0129 GMT, having dropped to its lowest since Dec. 12 at $8.88-1/4 a bushel on Monday.

* Corn gained 0.4% at $3.88 a bushel and wheat rose 0.1% to $5.70-1/2 a bushel.

* Concerns about the spread of a coronavirus in China continued to weigh on commodity markets.

* The death toll from the virus rose sharply to 132 on Wednesday with nearly 1,500 new cases, heaping pressure on Beijing to control the disease.

* The market is awaiting signs of a pick-up in Chinese demand promised when Washington and Beijing signed the Phase 1 trade deal on Jan. 15. China is by far the world's biggest soybean importer.

* U.S. soybean exporters are likely to face stiff competition from Brazil, which has just started harvesting a bumper crop.

* Brazilian farmers have harvested 4.2% of their planted area through Jan. 23, less than the 13% seen in the same year-ago period because of planting delays, AgRural said in a statement on Monday.

* The corn market is being underpinned by strong demand for U.S. supplies.

* Private exporters reported the sale of 124,335 tonnes of U.S. corn to Mexico for delivery in the 2019/20 marketing year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. It was the sixth flash sale of corn since Jan. 23.

* Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT corn futures contracts on Tuesday, traders said. They were net sellers of soybeans, wheat, soyoil and soymeal futures.

* Asian shares rose on Wednesday as better-than-expected Apple Inc earnings drove some regional tech gains although broader confidence was capped by worries about the economic impact of China's virus outbreak.
