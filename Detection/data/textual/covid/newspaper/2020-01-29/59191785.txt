Google to Temporarily Shutter All Offices in China Amid Coronavirus Outbreak 
 All Google offices in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan will be shut down. The offices are currently closed for the extended Lunar New Year holiday in an attempt to reduce the spread of the virus. However, a Google spokesperson has confirmed that the company will continue to keep its offices closed "in accordance with the government guidance."

The virus, which is officially known as 2019-nCoV and is related to the virus that causes sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), first began spreading in the central Chinese city of Wuhan some time between December 12 and December 29.

The World Athletics said Wednesday that it had postponed the Indoor World Championships slated for March in Nanjing, China, until 2021, over concerns that athletes could be put at risk by competing while the outbreak is ongoing, Sputnik reported.
