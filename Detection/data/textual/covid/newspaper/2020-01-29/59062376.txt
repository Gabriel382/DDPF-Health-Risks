A woman has claimed she and her two daughters were moved from their business class seats on a Thai Airways flight because they were "too big."The New Zealand Herald reports Huhana Iripa, 59, and daughters Tere, 37, and Renell, 28, were told they would not be able to sit in the business class seats they had purchased for a flight from Bangkok, Thailand to Auckland because they were "too big." Iripa told the newspaper they had to sit in economy instead.The flight was sometime this month, but an exact date was not given. It takes more than 11 hours to fly from Bangkok to Auckland, according to Thai Airways' website, which lists one nonstop flight per day between the two cities.

According to Iripa, the trio paid NZ$2,650 ($1,730) each for the business class seats, which they purchased to be more comfortable on their return to New Zealand.Iripa told the Herald: "We went up to business class check-in and the member of staff on the desk looked at us and said 'sorry you can't.'



"The next thing, there were about five members of staff all around talking in their native language, shaking their heads and looking at us as if we'd committed a crime."A staff member then came forward and started saying 'no, you're too big, you're too big.'"She then pulled out a measuring tape and wrapped it around my daughter Renell, moving her arms outstretched, before trying to do the same to me and Tere."Iripa added: "Everyone was just standing staring at us. The whole thing was disgusting."

Iripa said the family asked for a refund, but were only offered the difference between economy and business class, which was NZ$1,250 ($815) each. She also said the airline had apologized and offered a further NZ$450 ($293) in compensation, but she did not believe it was enough based on how she and her daughters were treated.



The Herald reports that Flight Centre, the travel agency the family booked their travels through, had offered a full refund.Thai Airways International New Zealand spokesperson Wayne Cochrane told the publication that Iripa and her daughters were not allowed to sit in business class because the type of plane they were flying on, a Boeing 7877-900 Dreamliner, had airbag seatbelts in business class, which could not be extended to fit all passengers."The extension seatbelt normally used to accommodate oversize passengers cannot be fitted to the airbag seatbelts; therefore passengers not able to fit the standard airbag seatbelt cannot be carried in business class."As this issue involves passenger safety, I am sure you will understand that we cannot compromise on this."
