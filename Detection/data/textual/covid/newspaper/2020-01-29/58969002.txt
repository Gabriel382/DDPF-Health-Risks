Customs on the lookout for virus-tainted shipments 
 MANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Customs (BOC) is on full alert status to prevent the entry and spread of the novel coronavirus and assured that it will keep a close eye on items shipped from countries with confirmed nCoV cases.

BOC Assistant Commissioner Vince Maronilla said Wednesday it is coordinating with the Department of Health (DOH) and Department of Agriculture (DA) in overseeing items, especially food products, arriving in the country.

“The intelligence and enforcement groups of the Bureau of Customs are now on full alert as per order of the Commissioner guarding against all items, not just food items, by which we coordinate with the DOH and the DA that might be a carrier or a source of carrying these diseases other than actual humans,” Maronilla said in a press briefing in Malacañang.

Maronilla said the BoC is also ensuring that all food products coming into the country are covered by permits and other requirements from the DA and the Food and Drug Authority (FDA).

“We’re leaving it to the Department of Agriculture if they will impose a ban or some stricter measure but right now, we don’t allow any importation of food products without the corresponding license coming from the Food and Drug Authority and the Department of Agriculture,” Maronilla said.

Maronilla said the BoC has intercepted some exotic animals at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) and assured that it is on top of the situation.

“We’ve intercepted some exotic animals usually dumadaan sa Ninoy Aquino International Airport. But very vigilant naman yung task force natin doon,” Maronilla said.

The death toll from the novel coronavirus in China has climbed to 132, with over 5,000 infected with the virus.

Meanwhile, the Department of Health (DOH) said the Philippines remains nCoV-free, but there 25 patients suspected of having the virus.
