Dow rises for second day as earnings overshadow coronavirus worries 
 Stocks traded higher Wednesday, as investors waded through a flood of corporate earnings reports, with better-than-expected results from blue-chip names, including Apple, Dow and McDonalds, helping to overshadow some of the concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA, +0.43% rose 148 points, or 0.5%, to 28,864, while the S&P 500 index  SPX, +0.33% gained 11 points, or 0.3%, to trade at 3,288. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.35% advanced 27 points, or 0.3%, at 9,298.

The Dow on Tuesday rose 187.05 points, or 0.7%, to end at 28,722.85, snapping a five-day losing streak and taking back a chunk of the previous session’s decline, which was the steepest one-day fall since October. The S&P 500 which has also suffered its biggest one-day drop since October on Monday, rose 32.61 points, or 1%, to finish at 3,276.24. The Nasdaq Composite closed at 9,269.68, up 130.37 points, or 1.4%.

Stocks were building on Tuesday’s recovery, after significant selloffs on Friday and Monday were sparked by fears of the economic impact of a spreading coronavirus, which has now infected at least 5,327 people in China, where the death toll rose to 132.

Apple shares gained 3% early to trade at a record high, after the company reported its second-best quarter for iPhone sales in the company’s history late Tuesday, while shares of Dow gained 5% after the materials sciences company reported adjusted profit and sales that fell less than expected.

“Who cares about a potential global pandemic when Apple reports results like that?” wrote Paul Hickey of Bespoke Investment Group in a Wednesday morning note. “With some relatively positive news (or a lack of truly bad news) related to the coronavirus overnight and solid earnings reports from the likes of AAPL and others,” the S&P 500 is on track to post solid gains, he added.

The results come on what could be the busiest single day of earnings season. Nearly 10% of the S&P 500 were scheduled to report Wednesday, including four members of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average. So far, nearly 25% of S&P 500 companies have reported results for the previous quarter. Of those companies, nearly 72% have beaten analyst expectations, FactSet data shows.

While Apple and a few other companies have clearly impressed investors, market participants are looking for broader confirmation that American corporations can grow earnings robustly enough this year to justify relatively earnings-per-share valuations for the S&P 500, said Willie Delwhiche, investment analyst at Baird, in an interview.

“There’s still this uncertainty around the virus and the global economy,” he said. “We had a rally yesterday in stocks, but bonds and copper didn’t confirm it.”

The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday confirmed the first Mideast cases of the virus. Cases have also been reported in Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam and Japan included patients who haven’t been to China, according to the New York Times. No deaths outside of China have been reported.

The Federal Reserve is fully expected to leave its policy interest rate unchanged when it concludes a two-day meeting Wednesday afternoon, but the central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell, might face a challenge in reassuring market participants as it makes technical adjustments.
