British Airways halts China flights over coronavirus 
 British Airways has stopped flying to and from China after Britain's foreign affairs ministry advised not to visit the country while the coronavirus continues to spread.

The pneumonia-like coronavirus has now killed 132 people, mostly in China, and there were 6000 confirmed cases.

"We have suspended all flights to and from mainland China with immediate effect following advice from the Foreign Office against all but essential travel," British Airways said in a statement reported by CNN.

"We apologize to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority. Customers due to travel to or from China in the coming days can find more information on ba.com."
