'I've been told my wife must stay in Wuhan' 
 A British man and his daughter have been offered a flight to the UK from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, but his Chinese wife has been told she must stay behind. 
The UK government is arranging to evacuate Britons from Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province.
Jeff Siddle, from Northumberland, said he had to decide whether to leave with his nine-year-old daughter or keep his family together.
"My wife is distraught," he said. 
"The Chinese authorities are not allowing any Chinese residents to leave."
It comes as British Airways has suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China because of the virus outbreak, which has caused more than 100 deaths. 
Mr Siddle and family travelled to Wuhan to spend Chinese New Year with relatives.
They were due to return to the UK on 1 February, but their flight was cancelled. Up to 300 British people are thought to be stranded in the Hubei area.
Mr Siddle said travel restrictions mean only he and his daughter would be allowed on board an airlift out of the city on Thursday. 
Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, he said: "My wife's a Chinese citizen although she's got a permanent residency visa for the UK as a spouse. 
"The Foreign Office are saying they're going to be doing an airlift possibly tomorrow but it's only British citizens." 
He added: "I had to make a decision where it's either my nine-year-old daughter, who's got a British passport, and myself to leave - and leave my wife here in China - or the three of us stay.
"We'd have to have a nine-year-old child separated from her mother. Who knows how long that could be for? 
"My daughter's obviously been in floods of tears. She's absolutely devastated.
"My wife's trying to keep strong but she's absolutely distraught. It was an awful decision."
