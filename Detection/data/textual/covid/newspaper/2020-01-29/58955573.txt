Crosby: Fox Valley workers on the front line against infectious disease outbreak 
 You read the headlines. You watch those post-apocalyptic movies. You might even be streaming Netflix’s compelling series “Pandemic,” that is, if nothing else, mighty timely considering the coronavirus outbreak that has recently taken up a fair chunk of the news cycle.The experts tell us it’s “not a matter of if but when” we have a horrible outbreak of a deadly disease that could kill millions of people around the world. Yet most of us don’t give it much thought unless it’s in our face through the media or Hollywood.Which is just fine, since it’s not our role to spend a lot of time worrying, according to local experts like Uche Onwuta, who want you to leave those sleepless nights to them.As director of disease prevention for Kane County, Onwuta and her team of specialists is willing to work 24/7 in order to keep communicable diseases from spreading here in the Fox Valley. She and her staff which partner directly with the healthcare community are currently monitoring about 72 such diseases, including those out there now and any on the horizon.And yes, she told me on Monday, she’d actually spent the previous night “working until midnight” on prevention measures for the deadly virus now making the news.“Right now we don’t have a case of it,” she said. “but we prepare for somebody who could have been in contact with the virus.”Every time a resident comes down with a communicable disease, that information is entered into a database, and that individual, as well as the healthcare provider, is extensively interviewed to mitigate the spread of the disease and educate those affected on how to keep the virus from spreading.Because each infectious disease behaves differently, there’s a protocol – put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and the Illinois Department of Health – as to how each one is to be handled, she said. Although the bigger scarier disease is coronavirus, “I would say I would be more worried about influenza,” said Onwuta, adding that the most important thing we can do to prevent its spread is simply “washing your hands."And getting immunized of course, which is becoming a more critical issue in light of the anti-vaccine movement experts say has led to a resurgence in some diseases that had all but been eradicated.Speaking of, Onwuta really did experience sleepless nights last May when a case of measles in the county sent her and her team into overdrive to prevent the kind of outbreak that occurred in New York City, where there were more than 600 confirmed cases.“That was a very scary time,” Onwuta recalled of what she described as a “huge undertaking” here locally to prevent a similar scenario.Because measles is an airborne disease, she explained, any area the infected person occupied even briefly becomes contagious for two hours. In this instance, the infected woman had traveled from the airport, been in a doctor’s waiting room as well as a healthcare lab and had even been to a restaurant and a couple of retail stores before the virus was identified.The fact she went to so many public places meant Onwuta’s team had to try to get in contact with anyone would could possibly have been exposed. And the several hundred people that had not been immunized were required to stay home for 21 days while they were closely monitored for any signs of the virus.“We are very lucky it did not go further,” said Onwuta, noting there were likely plenty of people who did not self-report out of concern they would have to miss work.“We were on pins and needles praying a second case did not start,” she admitted.Yet, like the majority of those who are on the front lines of infectious disease warfare, Onwuta has a passion for this line of work.It began, she said, at about 13 when she’d accompany her mother, a nurse in charge of a large urban health department in eastern Nigeria, to some of the more rural areas to distribute prenatal vitamins to those who were pregnant. In many cases, her mother was the only medical professional these women would see before delivering.Even though this childhood experience “piqued my interest” in community health outreach, Onwuta went on to get a degree in microbiology. She worked in a Chicago pharmaceutical research lab “until a birthday came alone” that made her reexamine her priorities. As satisfying as it was to hunt for that new antibiotic, she missed that human contact.“I wanted," she said, "to make more of an impact on community.”Although there’s little money in public health, Onwuta earned a master’s degree in it and, 20 years ago, joined the Kane County Health Department, where she oversees a team that Executive Director Barbara Jeffers describes as experienced and dedicated.Residents, she added, “can rest easier" with this team on the job.“We don’t know what diseases will break out, only that they will,” noted Jeffers. “And when they do, because of the work that’s being done on a global, federal and local level, we have infrastructures in place that the normal Joe should not even have to think about.“We worry so you don’t have to.”Although she’s never had to put her own health on the line, Onwuta didn’t hesitate when I asked about how far she’d go to keep a deadly virus from the public.“If the job demanded it," she insisted, “I would be ready to do what it takes.”dcrosby@tribpub.com
