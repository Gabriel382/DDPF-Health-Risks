UK families face being split up in coronavirus evacuation plans 
 British citizens trapped in the city at the epicentre of the fast-moving coronavirus outbreak have been told by the UK that their families must either stay put or split up if they do not all have British nationality.

Nick, an English teacher who has lived in Wuhan for 18 months, was told by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) that he and his two children, aged nine and 12, would be evacuated if they were prepared to leave his Indonesian wife behind.

"I am absolutely livid," he told The Telegraph. "I don't want to split my family up."

He said that the family had been staying in their house, barely leaving and washing their hands and clothes compulsively since the coronavirus - which has now killed more than 130 people and infected over 6,000 - was first identified.

The UK buckled to growing pressure earlier this week and announced that it would start to evacuate British nationals from Wuhan - between 200 and 300 are thought to be in the quarantined city, which is home to 11 million people.
