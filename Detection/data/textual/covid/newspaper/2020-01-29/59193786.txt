China's football stars consider return to Europe due to coronavirus 
 The coronavirus outbreak has forced the Chinese Super League’s high-profile stars to consider returning to Europe.

Sportsmail understands some of the league’s biggest names have instructed their representatives to explore exit routes out of China ahead of tomorrow night’s transfer deadline.

The coronavirus has claimed over 130 lives with almost 6,000 others suffering from symptoms. The virus is also causing significant disruption to everyday life in China.

Ex-Premier League players Marko Arnautovic, Paulinho, Mousa Dembele, Marouane Fellaini, Odion Ighalo, Salomon Rondon and Oscar are at Chinese clubs.

Ex-Ajax forward Richairo Zivkovic, who plays for Changchun Yatai, is hopeful of completing a move to Sheffield United.

The 23-year-old scored 16 goals and provided three assists last season in a productive campaign for his Chinese side.
