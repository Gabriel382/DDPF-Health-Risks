Assam vigil to stop Coronavirus outbreak | Guwahati News - Times of India 
 GUWAHATI: With vigil being stepped up across all states in view of the Coronavirus outbreak in China, Assam health department has issued advisories to the joint directors of health services stationed in the districts to screen persons for suspected case of Coronavirus infection if they have returned from China or Nepal, or have come in contact with people who have visited the two countries.Director of health services, Assam, Rathindra Bhuyan told TOI on Tuesday that isolated observation beds have been set up in district hospitals and medical colleges of the state to treat patients in case anybody is found to be affected by Coronavirus. "We have asked the health officials in the districts to be on alert and screen persons if they are suspected to be affected. This is especially for persons who have visited China or Nepal, or come in contact with those who visited the two countries," said Bhuyan.He added that the joint directors have been asked to screen these persons while looking out for symptoms such as fever or cough. If any suspected case is detected during screening, the patient's samples will be sent to National Institute of Virology in Pune.Minakshi Devi, state surveillance officer of Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP), said they are relieved that these persons are being screened by health experts in airports outside the state before they can come to Assam. Guwahati does not have direct flight connectivity with any of the cities in China or Nepal. However, IDSP has still asked the medical staff based in the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport to be on alert.Sources in the health department said that entry of people from Nepal to Assam through roadways may become a cause of worry if Coronavirus keeps spreading fast in the neighbouring country. "It's easy to screen the visitors from China in the airports where there is watertight security. But it is really difficult to keep track of people coming from Nepal through the border points," said a health department official.
