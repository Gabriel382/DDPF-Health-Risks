Hinsdale District 86 science teachers vouch for curriculum changes amid concerns from residents 
 A group of Hinsdale High School District 86 science teachers recently denied rumors that the new sequence of science courses, which will be introduced next school year, is being forced on them by district administrators.District 86 board members have said residents either have told them directly or posted on social media that some science teachers are against the change but aren’t speaking out for fear of repercussions.But during a board meeting Jan. 23, David Bonner, a physics teacher at Hinsdale South High School and one of the five science teachers writing the new curriculum, said he feels “absolutely” no pressure internally.“To the contrary, I felt very empowered by our administration and the school board to do what we feel as professionals ... is best," Bonner said, adding how that feeling is based on research and their own professional experiences. “It’s an ideal circumstance.”Some district residents have been concerned that the new sequence, which has freshmen, sophomores and juniors taking physics, chemistry and biology in that order, either will dilute the rigor of the curriculum or be too challenging for some freshmen who do not have the algebra skills needed to understand physics. District educators currently are writing the curriculum for the freshmen physics course, called physics in the universe.The notion that the changes are being forced on teachers or that administrators are dictating the new curriculum is “completely false,” said Dylan Canavan, a member of the curriculum writing team who is an earth science teacher at Hinsdale Central High School.“I firmly believe this is a better option,” said Canavan, who noted how some of the courses he has taught during his 18 years at Central will be eliminated under the new curriculum.Alan McCloud, an earth science teacher at Hinsdale Central, said that even if some people aren’t completely satisfied with the changes, the process still is in its early stages.“People resist change. It’s human nature," McCloud said. "But I think all of us who are directly involved are super excited about the direction things are going. People who are one or two steps removed from that are going to feel a little less connected and so, I think that makes them feel, perhaps, that their opinion is not as well thought of. But we are all listening to the people around us. We are not a closed book.”During the same meeting, Mark Miller, a district resident who said he is a former science teacher, expressed concerns that a student who wants to take the Advanced Placement biology course in junior year will be overwhelmed by the material since that student will not have taken a high-school-level biology course before that point.But Julie Gaubatz, chairwoman of the Hinsdale South science department, said biology is a complicated subject that requires a lot of reading and vocabulary and relates to controversial topics that may be too complex for a freshman.“When you look at what modern biology is right now, if you don’t understand chemical bonding and interaction between molecules, it is really difficult to think about the things you see in the news today,” Gaubatz said, referring to the coronavirus outbreak in China and the coronavirus cases in the United StatesGaubatz added: “This is a biological concept that relies almost exclusively on chemistry for us to understand how this virus works, how this virus spreads and how it reproduces. To really understand biology at a deep level, chemistry is very helpful.”She said the physics-chemistry-biology sequence gives students the chemistry and physics background they need to understand biological principles more fully.School Board President Nancy Pollak said the opinions of teachers who are directly involved in revising the science program are important to hear and also confirms what administrators have reported to board members.
