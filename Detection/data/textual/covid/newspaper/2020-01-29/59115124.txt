Air Canada offers booking changes on select flights to China amid coronavirus outbreak | The Star 
 Air Canada announced it will be cancelling select flights to China for several weeks amid the breakout of coronavirus in the country.

“We are cancelling select flights to China to better match capacity with expected demand,” wrote a spokesperson with the airline to the Star. “Air Canada currently operates 33 flights a week to China and the resulting capacity reduction is relatively small.”

“We continue to monitor the situation closely and will adjust accordingly.”

Customers travelling to Pudong Int. Airport, Beijing Capital Int. Airport, or Wuhan Tianhe Int. Airport can cancel their flight for a full refund, or change their flight plan free of charge “subject to availability in the cabin.”

Correction — January 28, 2020: This article has been amended from a previous version that misstated several facts. Air Canada is cancelling select flights to China, not all flights to China or Shanghai, and is offering customers the ability to refund or re-schedule flights to affected areas.
