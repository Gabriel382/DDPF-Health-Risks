Honolulu airport to begin screening for coronavirus 
 Federal health officials have expanded the number of U.S. airports conducting coronavirus screenings from five to 20, with Honolulu’s Daniel K. Inouye International Airport among them.


On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also issued a warning that travelers should avoid all nonessential travel to China.


            
            
        Airports in cities that include San Diego, Seattle, Detroit, Miami and Philadelphia are also slated to begin screenings. Screenings were already taking place at Los Angeles International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, and Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.


The airports will screen passengers arriving from China for possible symptoms of the virus. As the CDC explains on its website, travelers arriving from China will be required to answer a questionnaire about their travel and possible symptoms. CDC staff also will take the temperature of each traveler and examine them for a cough or difficulty breathing.


As Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech Monday, the 20 airports included in the list “receive 90% of all passengers from China.”


The outbreak of the virus is linked to Wuhan, China, the capital of the Hubei province that’s home to more than 11 million people. Since the virus was first detected in December, more than 4,500 cases have been reported in China, where the death toll has reached 106 as of Tuesday. Cases also have been confirmed in 17 countries outside of China, including the U.S., where five cases have been reported.
