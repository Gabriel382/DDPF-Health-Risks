Philadelphia airport to begin screening for coronavirus 
 Federal health officials have expanded the number of U.S. airports conducting coronavirus screenings from five to 20, with Philadelphia International Airport among them.

The move comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also issued a warning that travelers should avoid all nonessential travel to China.

Airports in cities that include San Diego, Seattle, Detroit, Miami and Honolulu are also slated to begin screenings. Screenings were already taking place at Los Angeles Internationalâ€¦
