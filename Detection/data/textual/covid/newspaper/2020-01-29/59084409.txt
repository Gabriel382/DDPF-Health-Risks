 A robot named Little Peanut is delivering food to people being quarantined after traveling on a flight with patients thought to be infected by the Wuhan coronavirus.

A video filmed in a hotel in Hangzhou, China, shows a robot with shelves of food moving from door-to-door carrying food to residents, Reuters reported.

"Hello everyone. Cute Little Peanut is serving food to you now," the robot was saying, according to a translation. "Enjoy your meal. If you need anything else, please message the staff on WeChat."

Multiple robots were employed on each floor of the 16-story hotel on Monday and Tuesday to reduce human contact and prevent spread of the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, Reuters reported.

The passengers from a flight to Hangzhou from Singapore are in quarantine after two of the more than 335 people on the plane were found with a fever, according to the Reuters report.

As of Wednesday morning local time, the novel coronavirus had killed 132 people in China and infected nearly 6,000 people worldwide.

It has spread outside mainland China to Australia, Cambodia, Canada, France, Germany, Ivory Coast, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.
