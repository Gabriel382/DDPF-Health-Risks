Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Wednesday with reporters following the central bank's two-day policy meeting. The central bank decided to keep rates unchanged on Wednesday. Over the past few months, Powell had been saying the Fed is unlikely to change interest rates so long as growth remains stable and inflation is contained.

Besides looking at monetary policy, the central bank also has a number of other tasks on its table. The Fed has been increasing the size of the bond holdings on its portfolio as it seeks to stabilize the overnight lending markets for banks and to keep its benchmark rate within its target range. In addition, officials over the last year have been listening to suggestions for how it can best meet its policy goals.

Powell will also likely be asked about the potential coronavirus impact on the global economy.
