Aussies in coronavirus epicentre to be evacuated to Christmas Island 
 Australians trapped in the Chinese city of Wuhan following an outbreak of coronavirus will soon be evacuated, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced.

Mr Morrison said the evacuations would be done on a "last in, first out" basis.

While he revealed the government’s intentions to remove Australians from Hubei province, he acknowledged it was a complex and complicated task.

“At this stage we are in the planning phase,” he said addressing the media on Wednesday.

The federal government will set up a quarantine centre on Christmas Island to house and treat everyone transported under the plan.

Mr Morrison said he would be focusing on Australians in Hubei who are “isolated and vulnerable”.

“There are some people who will be there for some time and effectively have been living there for some period of time,” he said.

“We are talking about people who are there not in those circumstances, those who don't have support structures in that place, those who are particularly vulnerable because they might have young children or they may be elderly.”

More to come.
