DOH exec: nCoV ‘less infectious’ than measles 
 MANILA, Philippines — The novel coronavirus or 2019nCoV, the new virus which originated from Wuhan, China, is less infectious than measles, an official from the Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.

“What we are saying is the [novel] coronavirus… is less [infectious], this one, mas nakakahawa ang tigdas [measles are more infectious],” Dr. Ferchito Avelino, officer-in-charge of DOH Epidemiology Bureau, said in a press briefing in Quezon City.

Avelino explained that those infected with the new virus can be transmitted to two to four persons “only at close range.”

But Health Chief Francisco Duque III said those infected with measles can be transmitted to 18 persons.

To recall, DOH declared a measles outbreak in the country in early February of 2019.  DOH reported that 80 percent of the deaths due to measles in the country in the first half of 2019 were children aged 1 to 4 years old and infants below 9 months.

Duque also assured the public that the Health department is equipped once they record a confirmed novel coronavirus from one of the persons under investigation (PUIs) for the virus.

“Handang-handa naman [We are ready]. This is not something that is entirely new to DOH and all of its operating units,” he said when asked if the Health Department is prepared once a person under investigation (PUIs) tested positive for novel coronavirus.

Duque said the DOH has isolation rooms that can treat patients who are infected with novel coronavirus.

“Remember these coronavirus has no treatment has no vaccines the intervention is… they are in a hospital, they are kept isolated they are given paracetamol for fever, wherever they might be feeling, hydration, everything nutrition will be taken care of all,” he said.

DOH earlier reported that there are 23 PUIs in the Philippines but it stressed that there are no confirmed cases of the virus.
