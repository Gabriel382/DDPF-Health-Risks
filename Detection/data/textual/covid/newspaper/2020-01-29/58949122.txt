Morrison announces new plans to combat coronavirus as death toll climbs 
 The federal government has unveiled plans to rescue Australians stranded in China's Hubei province where the coronavirus first emerged. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday said the operation - to be carried out in cooperation with the New Zealand government - would target "isolated and vulnerable" Australians. Mr Morrison said the government was establishing a quarantine zone on Christmas Island in preparation for the evacuees where people would remain on the island and undergo testing for an estimated 14 days. “We cannot give a guarantee that this operation is going to succeed,” Mr Morrison said. He also announced the government would release one million masks from the national stockpile. Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne said "we understand, from calls to the DFAT consular emergency line, that we have now just over 600 Australians currently registered in Hubei province for either advice or assistance". The death toll in mainland China now stands at 132. Image: AP
