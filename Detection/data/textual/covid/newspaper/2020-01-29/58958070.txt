Health Fears as Chinese Workers Return from Holiday 
 Thousands of Chinese workers and students are set to return here from their Lunar New Year trips home amid the rapid spread of coronavirus in China, sparking concerns in Korea.

An estimated 100,000 Chinese students, housekeepers, nursing home caretakers and restaurant workers are on their way back here. Politicians face mounting calls to block Chinese people from entering Korea, but the demands are unrealistic.

Some 71,067 Chinese students were studying in Korea as of April of last year, accounting for around 44 percent of all foreign students here.

Language institutes linked to universities here are cancelling classes. The Korean Language Education Center at Seoul National University cancelled all classes Tuesday and told students returning from China to quarantine themselves for a week. The Yonsei University Korean Language Institute and Korea University Korean Language Center announced the cancellations of classes until Wednesday, while Sungkyunkwan University Korean Language Center and Hanyang University will resume classes next week.

Hanyang University postponed the Thursday deadline for the submission of foreign student visas. An administrative staffer at Kyunghee University said, "Most Chinese students return to Korea around mid-February to prepare for the new semester and we expect that period to mark the crucial moment."

"We are looking into implementing special measures as parents are expected to visit their children who are graduating," the staffer added.

Meanwhile, some 56,000 Korean students are studying at universities and graduate schools in China, and considerable chaos is expected as many may come home to avoid the coronavirus outbreak.
