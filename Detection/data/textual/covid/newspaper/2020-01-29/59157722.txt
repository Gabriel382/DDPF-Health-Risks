Global box office could take multibillion-dollar hit from coronavirus outbreak 
 The coronavirus outbreak has forced almost all of China’s movie theaters to go dark — and could strike a multibillion-dollar blow to global box offices, a new report says.

The outbreak that has claimed more than 100 lives reportedly led film exhibitors to shut down about 70,000 screens in China, which helped power last year’s record-breaking global movie grosses.

Worldwide box office revenues could drop by $1 billion to $2 billion this year as Chinese moviegoers hide out at home and studios delay blockbuster releases because of the virus, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

“There could be a potential recovery from the loss of a few weeks, but with a longer hiatus possibly on the horizon and real estate values being severely challenged, unless the government is motivated to step in with additional support, this could be a disaster in the making,” Stephen Saltzman, a partner at the Paul Hastings law firm, told the magazine.

The theaters that stayed open last weekend for the start of the Lunar New Year holiday — during which many Chinese people would normally take in movies — raked in just $2 million together, THR reported. That’s down from a whopping $507 million in the first three days of last year’s holiday, a number analysts expected to be surpassed this year, according to the story.

Major Chinese studios indefinitely pushed back openings of six big titles that were set to debut for the holiday weekend, including Jackie Chan’s “Vanguard” and the comedy “Lost in Russia,” though the studio Huanxi Media released the latter for free online instead, according to THR.

Several buzzy American films, including “Little Women” and “Dolittle,” are slated to be released in China next month on the heels of the US awards season — but the outbreak has now cast doubt on those plans, the story said.

“No one knows what is coming next, but we are operating under the assumption that all new releases scheduled for February will be canceled,” the CEO of a Beijing-based firm that has the release rights in China for an Oscar-nominated film told THR.
