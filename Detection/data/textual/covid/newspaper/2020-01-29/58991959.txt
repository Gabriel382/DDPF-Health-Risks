 NanoViricides President and Chairman Anil Diwan discusses the process of developing a treatment for the coronavirus.




The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has expanded monitoring for coronavirus among travelers to 15 more U.S. airports with quarantine stations, the CDC said on Monday.
The CDC had already implemented "enhanced health screenings" for travelers who had passed through Wuhan, China, and landed in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City last week. The practice has now been expanded to a total of 20 airports with quarantine stations in the U.S.

"At this time, there are no confirmed cases of the Coronavirus in Texas," the airport wrote on Twitter. "As a preventative measure, the CDC has announced it will expand screenings to 15 additional airports which includes George W. Bush Intercontinental Airport."
The United States and several other nations prepared Tuesday to airlift citizens out of the Chinese city at the center of a virus outbreak that has killed more than 100 people.
