Coronavirus pilot sent to expatriate people from China seen wearing hazmat suit 
 A pilot sent to expatriate people from China because of the Coronavirus has been pictured wearing hazmat suit.

The pilot was seen parking an aircraft at the unloading area of the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province.

Around 200 British nationals are currently in Wuhan and passengers may be asked to sign a contract before they board the plane home.

It is likely that they will be held at a military base.

The Foreign Office advised against "all but essential" travel to mainland travel China and British Airways has halted flights to the country until March.

Members of the Thai Airways crew were earlier seen disinfecting the cabin of an aircraft of the national carrier during a procedure to prevent the spread of the coronavirus at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi International Airport.

Three cargo airplanes arrived at the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport on Tuesday, bringing over 60 tons of medical and protective materials, including face masks, medical caps, latex gloves, protective clothing, disinfectant.

Over 16 countries have been affected by the disease which has taken the lives of 130 people in mainland China.

People have gone to extreme measures to avoid getting the coronavirus - by putting plastic bottles over their heads.

This comes after British Airways suspended all flights to and from mainland China in response to the outbreak, which originated in Wuhan.

Survivalists in the UK have now begun prepping for a coronavirus outbreak as China confirmed over 6,000 cases of the deadly disease.

Worryingly, people seem to think Coronavirus is linked to Corona beerâ€“ with searches searches for "beer virus" spiking since China's deadly outbreak.
