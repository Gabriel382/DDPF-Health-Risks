To Treat Coronavirus Patients, China Converts Empty Building Into 1,000-Bed Hospital In 2 Days 
 That the Chinese are quick to take corrective action when it comes to anything, is a fact known to all. And their reaction was no different when it came to the recent coronavirus outbreak. China reportedly opened its first coronavirus hospital on January 28 in ground zero, a city near Wuhan, from where the virus first began to spread. 
Workers and volunteers, construction firms and paramilitary police officers just took two days to convert an empty building into a 1,000-bed emergency facility, Daily Mail reported.

The first batch of coronavirus patients has already been transferred to the Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Centre, according to local media. Since the project involved the conversion of an empty building into a makeshift hospital, it was completed within 48 hours. 
The building in the city's Guangzhou District was originally built as a new branch of Huanggang Central Hospital and expected to open in May.

 On Friday, the authorities asked the complete but empty building to be used for treating coronavirus patients only. 
By Monday, beds were set up by volunteers. And facilities like water, electricity and Internet were also installed, claims the government of Huanggang.
Huanggang is situated 75 kilometres (46.6 miles) south-west of Wuhan, and has a population of around 7.5 million. It is one of the cities that have been hit by the coronavirus the hardest. 
It went into lockdown the same day as Wuhan.
The government of Wuhan announced that they would build a coronavirus hospital in a week and its construction is already underway. 
These facilities are modelled on the temporary medical centre in Beijing in 2003, which was constructed in seven days to tackle SARS. It treated one-seventh of the country's SARS patients in the space of two months. 
Meanwhile, there are at least four such hospitals that have been completed or being constructed.
