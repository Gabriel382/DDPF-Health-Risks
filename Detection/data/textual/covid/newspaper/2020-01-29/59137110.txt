A Western Australian adult is being tested for the deadly coronavirus.

Health Minister Roger Cook confirmed the new screening on Wednesday, one day after the state had been given the all-clear for the virus.

Mr Cook said cautionary policies have been updated and asked anyone that had travelled from the Hubei province to self-isolate for 14 days.

"No outings, no visitors, no work. We want you to stay in your home and have as minimum contact as humanly possible," he said.
