Losses for oil companies, Diageo weigh on FTSE 100 
 The FTSE 100 struggled for gains on Wednesday, weighed down by losses for oil companies and beverage maker Diageo PLC, while investors looked ahead to the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting.

The index UKX, +0.22%   lagged behind gains for other regional European bourses, with a gain of just 0.1% to 7490. The British pound GBPUSD, -0.2226%  slipped 0.2% against the U.S. dollar. Earlier in the session, the FTSE 100 climbed above 7500, as investors cheered record results from U.S. technology giant Apple Inc. AAPL, +2.83%

U.S. stock futures climbed as investors focused on a heavy earnings reporting calendar and the Fed policy statement later, and attempted to brush aside concerns over the growing coronavirus outbreak. The death toll in China rose to at least 132 and number of infected was close to 6,000.

Heavily weighted oil stocks were under pressure, with Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDS.A, -0.30% RDSA, -0.19%   slid 1%, while BP PLC BP, -0.08% BP, +0.21%  dipped 0.6%.

Also weighing were losses for consumer goods group Unilever PLC ULVR, -0.83% UL, +1.06%  dropped 1.5%. Shares of Diageo PLC DGE, -1.97%, another heavyweight, fell 2.3%. The company is due to report interim results on Thursday.

British Airways, which is operated by International Consolidated Airlines Group became the latest airline to restrict flights to China. The airline said all flights to the region have been canceled effective immediately. Shares of IAG, -0.07%  fell 0.7% in London trading.

Away from the main index, shares of Wizz Air Holdings PLC WIZZ, +3.65%  jumped 3.4% after the cut-rate airline reported higher profit and lifted its guidance.

“Wizz’s dominant position in its core markets does limit the risk of people turning to a competitor, while its European focus should insulate it from the impact of China’s coronavirus on the travel sector, for now at least,” said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
