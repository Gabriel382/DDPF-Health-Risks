TOKYO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose for a second day on Wednesday, standing on firmer ground after a five-day rout on talk that OPEC could extend oil cuts if a new coronavirus hurts demand, while data showing a decline in U.S. stockpiles also helped steady prices.

OPEC wants to extend oil production cuts until at least June from March, and may deepen the reductions should demand for oil in China be significantly reduced by the spread of the virus, OPEC sources said.

OPEC and its allies that form a grouping known as OPEC+ will next be meeting in Vienna in March to decide on any further action on its output reduction agreement.
