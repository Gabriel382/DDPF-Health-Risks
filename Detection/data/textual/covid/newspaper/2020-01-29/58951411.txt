Around 50 Filipinos in Wuhan want to go home amid virus scare 
 MANILA, Philippines — Around 50 Filipinos in Hubei province, mostly from Wuhan City, have so far expressed desire to return to the Philippines as the novel coronavirus death toll in China rises.

Citing estimates from the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai, Foreign Affairs Secretary Eduardo Meñez said there are around 300 Filipino in Hubei province, with 150 in Wuhan City, which is the epicenter of the virus outbreak.

“About 50 so far have indicated desire to leave. Any repatriation would need to consider their safety, in coordination with Chinese authorities’ approval,” Meñez told reporters in a Viber message on

 Wednesday.

“Mostly from Wuhan I believe so far. Everything is still being coordinated and considered so no details yet – as was mentioned, it may be safer to stay put,” he added.

Earlier, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) expressed readiness in repatriating Filipinos in Wuhan and the rest of Hubei Province “subject to China’s rules on Disease Containment, including

 immigration clearance and quarantine process, among others.”

DFA has reminded that Filipinos who will arrive in the Philippines will be subjected to 14 days of quarantine as ordered by the Department of Health.

For Filipinos who would wish to stay in China, the DFA advised them to coordinate with local health authorities to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
