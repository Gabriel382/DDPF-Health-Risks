Victorian health authorities confirm second case of coronavirus, bringing Australian total to six 
 Victoria's chief health officer Brett Sutton has revealed that the state has confirmed its second case of coronavirus.

Mr Sutton said the second case was a Victorian resident aged in his 60s who became unwell on January 23.

The man went to his general practitioner and was tested and was then referred to the Monash Medical Centre where he was tested again.

Dr Sutton said the man had since returned home, where he was in isolation.

The man’s family is undergoing ongoing monitoring and while some have exhibited symptoms none have returned a positive test yet.

"The man was mostly at home and had isolated himself when unwell but he had gone out to a restaurant called The House of Delight for a short period of time," Dr Sutton said.

"That restaurant has been followed up with and those who were there at the same time, whose contact details we have, we are following up with.

"But obviously that restaurant is OK to go to now. People don’t need to avoid that area or indeed anywhere else people have been, even if infectious at the time."

The latest diagnosis brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Australia to six: four in New South Wales, and two in Victoria.

Dr Sutton said the results of tests on 14 more Victorians were still pending while 61 people who were initially suspected of having the virus had come back with negative tests.

He said the total number of people coming to Australia who had recently been to Wuhan was unclear.

"We can't know for sure those individuals who might have started their journey in Wuhan," he said.

"We will only know the number of people who are on flights from China on a daily basis."

More to come.
