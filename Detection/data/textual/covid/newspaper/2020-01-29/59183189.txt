Peter Dutton defends quarantine zone on Christmas Island 
 Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton says the government does not “have an empty hospital sitting around” but has a facility “made for" an event such as the coronavirus outbreak on Christmas Island. Mr Dutton told Sky News “it’s not easy to find a facility” but Christmas Island is a “very different facility than what people imagine in their minds from 10 years ago”. “I just don’t have an empty hospital sitting around, we have a facility made for this type of event on Christmas Island," he said. “We want to make sure Australians are safe and there’s not a spread of the disease, of the virus.” Image: News Corp Australia
