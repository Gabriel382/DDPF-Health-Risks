Kuo forecasts new Apple products coming this year including wireless charging mat, UWB tags, and high-end headphones 
 A report from Ming-Chi Kuo today centered on the impact to Apple’s supply chain of the coronavirus. Nested in the report, Kuo mentions several new products from Apple expected to arrive in the first half of 2020.

The lineup includes the iPhone SE 2, a new iPad Pro and MacBooks with scissor keys, and most interestingly a “smaller wireless charging mat, UWB tag, and a high-end Bluetooth headphone”.

The rumors about an Ultra-Wideband powered Apple Tag were fierce last year, originating from 9to5Mac code findings. However, the product was not released in 2019 as many expected. Kuo’s today report implies the product is still coming, sooner rather than later.
