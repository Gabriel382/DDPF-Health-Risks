Airlines suspend some flights to China over coronavirus 
 Jan 29 (Reuters) - Major airlines have suspended some of their flights to China after the coronavirus outbreak that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan killed more than 130 people in China and spread across the world.

Here are the airlines that have suspended some of their flights to China:

The British carrier said on Jan. 29 it has suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China after Britain warned against all but essential travel to the country due to the coronavirus outbreak.

BA.com, the airline's website, showed no direct flights to China were available to book in January and February, but the airline said in an email that the cancellations were until Jan.31 while it assesses the situation.

Finnish airline Finnair said on Jan. 28 it would suspend its routes to Nanjing and Beijing Daxing until end of March after China suspended international group travel from the country.

Finnair will suspended its three weekly flights between Helsinki and Beijing Daxing International Airport between Feb. 5 and March 29, and its two weekly flights between Helsinki and Nanjing between Feb. 8 and March 29.

Chicago-based United said it was suspending 24 U.S. flights to Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai between Feb. 1 and Feb. 8 due to a significant drop in demand.

Air Canada said on Jan. 28 it was cancelling select flights to China to better match capacity with expected demand.

Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific said it would be progressively reducing capacity to and from mainland China by 50% or more from Jan. 30 to the end of March, in line with a government directive as well as market demand. (Reporting by Jagoda Darlak and Tommy Lund in Gdansk; Editing by Josephine Mason)
