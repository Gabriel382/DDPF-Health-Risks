Workers Race to Lay Foundation of New Hospital in Wuhan, China 
 Hundreds of workers in Wuhan, China, raced to lay the foundation of a new hospital being built to handle cases of the new coronavirus, video recorded January 28 shows. Construction began on January 23, media reported. Visible in this footage are countless construction machines and workers. According to the person who visited the site and shot this video, due to the lockdown of Wuhan, there is a shortage of workers at the construction site. The new hospital — which is modeled on prefab facilities quickly erected during the SARS outbreak — is meant to house 1,000 beds. Authorities plan to complete construction in less than two weeks. The official death toll from the virus stood at 133 on Wednesday, January 29, according to reports.
