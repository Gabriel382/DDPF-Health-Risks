Coronavirus outbreak: Manipur, Myanmar govt step up screening of visitors along Indo-Myanmar border 
 In view of the recent Coronavirus outbreak in mainland China which may result in the infiltration of the virus across borders, the Manipur government and the Myanmar government have stepped up the screening of visitors at airports and check posts.

The Manipur Health department had deployed medical officers in Indo-Myanmar border towns of Moreh and Behiang to screen any person -- both foreigners and Indians -- coming to India after travelling from China and adjacent countries for coronavirus-like symptoms.

Meanwhile, the Myanmar government has also passed an order to conduct the screening of travellers for coronavirus-like symptoms at all the bordering state's entrance and check posts.

Following the order, three teams comprising one doctor, one female nurse and one male nurse of Tamu district hospital under Myanmar medical department started the screening process using Infrared Thermometer at Indo-Myanmar Friendship gate number 1 and 2.

The death toll from a new coronavirus in China rose sharply to 132 on Wednesday with nearly 1,500 new cases, as Japan said it flew citizens out of the central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

At the same time, several people across India, who are suspected of being affected by the coronavirus, have been kept under observation even as the state governments have taken precautions to combat the issue.
