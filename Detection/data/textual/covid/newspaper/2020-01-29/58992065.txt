Morrison scored ‘full marks’ for National Press Club address: Credlin 
 Whether it is “jurisdictionally accurate” or not, the Australian public “expect leadership from the prime minister” on issues of national importance such as the coronavirus and bushfires, says Sky News host Peta Credlin. In his National Press Club address on Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison defended his government’s position to keep the budget in surplus despite the ongoing drought and bushfire crises. Mr Morrison also outlined an operation to remove Australians trapped in Wuhan due to the current coronavirus threat. Ms Credlin said the prime minister has shown he is “determined” not to let the coronavirus “get on top of him, the way the bushfire crisis initially did”. “Rightly or wrongly, on any big issue these days, people expect leadership from the prime minister” even if “many of the constitutional responsibilities are the job of the states”. Ms Credlin said Mr Morrison “did two things very well” during his address on Wednesday, primarily in the way he addressed the government’s role in future disasters and the plan he outlined to tackle the deadly coronavirus outbreak. “So, on bushfires and national powers, as well as the coronavirus disease, full marks to the prime minister today,” she said.
