2 Japanese Returnees from Wuhan Diagnosed with Pneumonia - JIJI PRESS 
 Tokyo, Jan. 29 (Jiji Press)--Two of the 206 Japanese nationals brought back on a government-chartered plane from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of a new coronavirus outbreak, on Wednesday have been diagnosed with pneumonia. 

    The two are among the five people who felt unwell and were sent to two hospitals designated as institutions to deal with specific infectious diseases following the flight's arrival at Tokyo International Airport at Haneda. Three of them are men in their 30s to 50s, and two are women in their 50s.

    It is unclear whether the pneumonia of the pair was caused by the new strain of coronavirus, authorities said.

    According to the Tokyo metropolitan government, four of the five people were admitted to Ebara Hospital in Tokyo's Ota Ward. Two of them, a man in his 40s and a man in his 50s complained of such symptoms as a cough and a fever and were diagnosed with the disease after undergoing computed tomography scan tests.

    One of the two women was admitted to Komagome Hospital in Tokyo's Bunkyo Ward.
