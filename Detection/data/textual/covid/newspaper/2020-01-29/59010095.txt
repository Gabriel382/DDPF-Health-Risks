KNUST denies manufacturing coronavirus vaccine 
 The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) has denied reports suggesting that some students of the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry of the university have successfully created and tested a Coronavirus vaccine.

 

 There were reports that an 8-member medical student team from the KNUST completed works on the vaccine last week and travelled to Ivory Coast when the first case of coronavirus was reported in that country over the weekend.

 

 According to the reports, the students told the press that two of them were in China on an exchange program when the first case of the virus infection was reported.

 

 They allegedly collected samples of the virus from China to their laboratory on campus where they found a cure to it.

 

 However, a press release signed by the University Relations Officer, Dr Norris Daniel Bekoe, said the KNUST had made no such discoveries.

 

 It indicated that the supervisor who is alleged to have supervised the project, one Professor Dr Isreal Nluki, has no affiliations with the university.

 

 “Management thus urges the general public to disregard such publication,” the statement added.
