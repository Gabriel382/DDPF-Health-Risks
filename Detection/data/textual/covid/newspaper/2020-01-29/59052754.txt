Thousands of medics from around China are being brought in to Wuhan and its surrounding region to help authorities respond to the ever-growing number of cases of the coronavirus that has now killed 132 people.China's National Health Commission (NHC) said Tuesday that by the end of the day, around 6,000 medical workers from across the country will have been sent to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, to help contain the virus. The news was reported by the state-run China Daily newspaper.Some 4,130 health workers had already arrived in the city as of 8 p.m. Tuesday local time, China Daily reported at the time, and another 1,800 were expected to arrive before Wednesday."The medical workers are specialized in different areas, including respiratory and infectious diseases," Jiao Yahui, the NHC's deputy chief for medical administration and supervision, told reporters, according to China Daily.Many of the medics being flown in, Yahui said,Â are "very experienced in similar emergency relief operations and have taken part in fighting the SARS outbreak in 2003 or helped controlling the Ebola outbreak in Africa."



China is taking aggressive measures to try and prevent the virus from spreading, including quarantining Wuhan and many other cities in Hubei province, and panic-building two new hospitals in Wuhan in under a week.

With Wuhan under quarantine, the city's doctors also say they are being overwhelmed by the growing number of cases and lack of medical equipment to meet the surge.Doctors in Wuhan have reported on hours-long waits at hospitals, difficulties in screening the disease, and a lack of protective gear. Some doctors have even been told at times not to go to work over fears they could catch the virus.Wuhan virus officially outstrips SARS on the mainlandNews of the extra medical workers arriving in Hubei came soon before the NHC confirmed that the number of cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in mainland China officially eclipsed the number of SARS cases during its 2003 outbreak.
