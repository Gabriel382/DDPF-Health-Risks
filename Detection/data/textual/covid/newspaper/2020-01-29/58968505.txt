A plane carrying U.S. diplomats and their families left Wuhan, China on Tuesday, and is bound for California. The chairman of the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors, Curt Hagman, told CNN that officials were preparing to house the individuals in isolation anywhere between three days and two weeks. Hagman said an isolated airplane hangar in Ontario, California was being equipped with beds, televisions, and phone chargers. “They’re going to be isolated from the plane. They’re not going to the public areas of the airport. They’re not going to be exposed to the general public until CDC clears them to go on their way,” Hagman said.
