Australian scientists grow coronavirus outside China in bid to fight illness 
 A team of scientists in Australia has become the first to grow coronavirus in a laboratory outside China – a move which will help researchers study the pathogen which has killed at least 130 people. 

    

            
              
                
                
                  











  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    Scientists from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne grew the Wuhan coronavirus from a patient sample, and described the success as a “game changer”. 

    

            
              
                
                
                  



  


  












  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    The virus isolate, which was grown in a cell culture, will provide international laboratories with crucial information to help combat the spread of the deadly illness.

    “Chinese officials released the genome sequence of this novel coronavirus, which is helpful for diagnosis, however, having the real virus means we now have the ability to actually validate and verify all test methods, and compare their sensitivities and specificities – it will be a game changer for diagnosis,” said Dr Julian Druce of the Royal Melbourne Hospital.

    

            
              
                
                
                  





  









  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    “The virus will be used as positive control material for the Australian network of public health laboratories, and also shipped to expert laboratories working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe.”

    The Doherty Institute-grown virus is expected to be used to generate an antibody test, which allows detection of the virus in patients who haven’t displayed symptoms and were therefore unaware they had the virus.

    

            
              
                
                
                  











  
    
  

  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    Dr Mike Catton, deputy director of the Doherty Institute said: “An antibody test will enable us to retrospectively test suspected patients so we can gather a more accurate picture of how widespread the virus is, and consequently, among other things, the true mortality rate.
