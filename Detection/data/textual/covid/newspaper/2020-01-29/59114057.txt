AFP via Getty ImagesCommercial air service between the U.S. and China is feeling the impact of the coronavirus.
United Airlines, the second largest carrier in the market after Air China, said Tuesday it would temporarily reduce its schedule, cancelling  24 round-trip flights between February 1 and February 8. 
United cited a “significant decline in demand” on the routes. It flies a dozen daily flights to China and has canceled three or four flights  a day. Going forward, United said, “We will adjust our schedule as needed.”
So far, United is the only carrier to cancel flights between the U.S. and China. 
In terms of passengers carried non-stop between the two countries, Air China is the largest, followed by United, Hainan Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Xiamen Airlines and Sichuan Airlines, according to aviation analytics firm OAG.
About 4% of United revenue derives from China, while 10% of United revenue derives from Asia, according to Cowen  Co. analyst Helane Becker. That is far more than peers. American derives 2% of revenue from China and 3% from Asia, Becker said, while Delta derives 4% from China and 5% from Asia.
United has 4% of its capacity in China, Delta has 3% and American has 2%. 
Shares in all three carriers have fallen since Jan. 17, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it would begin screening passengers at Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York Kennedy airports. The CDC said Tuesday that it would expand screening to 20 airports.
As of Tuesday’s close, United shares were down 14%, Delta shares down 7% and American shares down 5%.
The virus’ long-term impact on commercial air travel is unclear.
Airport consultant Mike Boyd wrote Tuesday in Forbes that, “Air traffic between the United States and China is spinning into a free-fall.
“This event is going to devastate traffic for a period of at least six months or maybe longer,” Boyd said. “Depending on the developments in China, through this June we are forecasting at least a 75% drop in passenger traffic between the USA and China. That figure sounds extreme, but as the knowledge of the nature and the extent of the new virus grows, it may actually be optimistic.”
However, John Grant, OAG senior analyst, said events such as the outbreak of the coronavirus “are a regular occurrence in the global aviation industry, and airlines, airports and authorities have well tested control processes that they put in place to safeguard the travel community. 
“Demand for air travel is remarkably resilient, particularly in emerging markets and we should expect the normal bounce-back in travel that we have seen with similar events,” Grant said.
