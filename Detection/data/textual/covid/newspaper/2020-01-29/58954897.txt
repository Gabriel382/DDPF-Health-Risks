Spread of coronavirus through Khunjerab Pass feared 
 GILGIT: The government of Gilgit-BaltisÂ­tan has expressed fears about the spread of coronavirus through Khunjerab Pass.

An official of the Gilgit-Baltistan health department told Dawn on Tuesday that all preventative measures were being taken to contain the infectious disease.

The health department has recommended deployment of medical staff to the border to check the disease and isolate patients and refer them for treatment.

Thermal scanners and other equipment, including gloves, surgical masks, disposable garments and long aprons as well as ambulances, would be available at the border.

The people who travel to China frequently would be identified and screened.

Meanwhile, dozens of political activists staged a protest outside the Gilgit Press Club against proposed opening of Khunjerab pass from February 2 to 8.
