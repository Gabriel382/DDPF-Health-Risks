Gussa outbreak: JDU's Ajay Alok calls Prashant Kishor a coronavirus 
 It should come as no surprise that a JD(U) leader is unhappy with Prashant Kishor's dissent, but surely no one expected Ajay Alok to call his party's vice-president a coronavirus.

That jab, of course, was a reference to the deadly epidemic sweeping China and causing alarm across the world. But you may ask: Gussa kyun?

To start with, Prashant Kishor has been a vocal critic of the central government's amended citizenship law, and insists his party should contest in a significantly higher number of assembly seats than the BJP -- its ally -- in the Bihar election due this year.

A renowned election strategist, Prashant Kishor is also helping Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party try and retain power in Delhi -- and keep the BJP at bay.

On Tuesday, Kishor reacted unhappily to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's claim that he was inducted into the JD(U) on former BJP chief (and now Home Minister) Amit Shah's recommendation.

He aired his views in public, and minced no words. Take a look.

In an interview with ANI, Ajay Alok said Kishor wasn't trustworthy, and that the party was happy he was leaving.

There has been no official announcement on Prashant Kishor's future in the JD(U).
