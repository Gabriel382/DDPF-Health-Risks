Qld coronavirus case remains in isolation 
 A 44-year-old Chinese national remains isolated in a Gold Coast hospital with the coronavirus

A Chinese national from the epicentre of the lethal coronavirus outbreak remains isolated in a Queensland hospital after becoming infected.

Authorities on Wednesday night confirmed the man as the first case of coronavirus detected in the state.

Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said the 44-year-old man had been isolated at the Gold Coast University Hospital.

The man is from the Chinese city of Wuhan, humans first became infected with the virus.

He is in a stable condition, Queensland Health said in a statement.

The Chinese women's national football team also remains in isolation in their Brisbane city hotel as a precautionary measure after arriving on a flight from Shanghai.

"We are working closely with the hotel and the 32 individuals concerned, who are all well and not showing symptoms, and we have Queensland Health staff present at the hotel," Dr Young said.

New state government requirements ask Queensland residents to self-isolate for 14 days after travelling to Wuhan.

Authorities will provide an update on the circumstances surrounding the first confirmed Queensland infection later on Thursday morning.

A further 19 people in the state have been tested for the virus.
