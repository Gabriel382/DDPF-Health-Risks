Coronavirus medical experts warn to 'stay away from school' 
 Education Minister Dan Tehan says as the coronavirus disrupts the start to the new school year, “the advice is if you have been in contact with someone who has the virus, or are showing flu-like symptoms, you should stay away”. Mr Tehan told Sky News is it “the same advice we have been providing to schools, childcare centres, vocational education providers and universities for the last four or five days”. “We must understand that this advice is coming from leading medical experts, and what the government has said is we will continue to take that advice,” he said.
