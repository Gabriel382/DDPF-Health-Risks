Humans are to blame for coronavirus epidemic 
 The latest scary new virus that has captured the world's horrified attention, caused a lockdown of 56 million people in China, disrupted travel plans around the globe and sparked a run on medical masks from Wuhan, Hubei province, to Bryan, Texas, is known provisionally as 2019-nCoV.

It is a clunky moniker for a lurid threat. The name, picked by the team of Chinese scientists who isolated and identified the virus, is short for "novel coronavirus of 2019". It reflects the fact that the virus was first recognised to have infected humans late last year - in a seafood and live-animal market in Wuhan - and that it belongs to the coronavirus family, a notorious group.
