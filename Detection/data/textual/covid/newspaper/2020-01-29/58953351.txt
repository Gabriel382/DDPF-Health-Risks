Qld tourism to be impacted by coronavirus 
 Australian tourism leaders are fearful the coronavirus will cause a plunge in the number of Chinese visitors. Almost half a million Chinese tourists visited the sunshine state in the year ending September, injecting about $1.5 billion into the state's tourist economy. China's suspension on group travel is going to have an impact on Australia's tourism industry, particularly as it is still recovering from the impacts of the bushfires and drought.
