PayPal forecast comes up short, company announces 52 million active Venmo accounts 
 PayPal Holdings Inc. delivered better-than-expected results Wednesday for its holiday quarter, but the company’s forecast came up short.

The digital-payments giant posted net income of $507 million, or 43 cents a share, down from $584 million, or 49 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. PayPal PYPL, +0.12%  said that the per-share earnings were impacted by 2-cent net unrealized gain from strategic investments, mainly in MercadoLibre MELI, -0.91%. They also included a 19-cent negative impact from taxes related to its iZettle acquisition.

Adjusted earnings per share rose to 86 cents from 69 cents, whereas analysts surveyed by FactSet had been modeling 83 cents.

PayPal’s revenue grew to $4.96 billion from $4.22 billion a year prior. That came in above the FactSet consensus, which called for $4.94 billion.

The company logged total payment volume of $199 billion, up from $163.6 billion a year prior but below the FactSet consensus of $202.5 billion. The company said that volume growth reflects that it is lapping the 2018 acquisitions of Hyperwallet and iZettle.
