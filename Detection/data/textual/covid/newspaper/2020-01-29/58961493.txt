WHO Says Coronovirus may Spread even without Symptoms 
 The World Health Organization(WHO) says the new strain of coronavirus may be transmitted to humans even though those infected with it don't reveal symptoms.


However, WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday this is still yet to be proven.


He said they have been informed by medical personnel that the latent period is between one and 14 days and can't pin down the degree of infection that may lead to transmissions.


The spokesperson said while China is under a state of emergency, other regions outside China are not showing a rampant spread.


Still the WHO hasn't ruled out issuing an international state of emergency.
