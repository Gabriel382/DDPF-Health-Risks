BI designates special team to handle Filipinos coming from China 
 MANILA, Philippines–A dedicated team of Immigration personnel will handle the formalities for Filipinos returning from Wuhan and other areas in China affected by the 2019 novel coronavirus, Justice Undersecretary and DOJ spokesperson Markk Perete said Wednesday.

“A dedicated team of immigration officers will conduct the immigration procedures and formalities. I understand they will also be quarantined after,” Perete said.

He said the team has undergone briefings by the Bureau of Quarantine and will be provided with protective gear.

The Justice spokesperson said repatriation covers only the Filipinos in Hubei province of which the capital city is Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.

Currently, there are around 300 Filipinos in Hubei province, half of which are in Wuhan.

On the importance of Immigration procedures, Perete explained that: “We want to make sure that our security is not compromised by those who seek to gain entry into our territory by exploiting the current situation. We need to remember that terrorism, among others, remains as valid a threat as the current medical emergency we are facing.”

Last Tuesday, DFA Undersecretary for Civilian Security and Consular Concerns Dodo Dulay said the government will make available special flights to repatriate Filipinos from Wuhan city and the rest of Hubei province.

Dulay said those Filipinos who want to stay in China should follow health advisories issued by local authorities and cooperate with efforts to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus.

He said Filipinos requiring assistance, emergency and medical supplies and other needs related to the virus should contact the 24-hour hotlines established by the Chinese Foreign Ministry  at +86-278712-2256 and +86-278781-1173.
