ASX 200 rebounds after investor coronavirus concerns 
 Australian shares climbed 0.6 per cent after the ASX 200 fell on Tuesday following concerns about the deadly coronavirus. Corporate Travel Management and Qantas acknowledged the threat of the coronavirus, but said it was too early to assess the impact it would have on shares. Travel companies and airlines rebounded on Wednesday and approximately a third of the losses were recovered from the drop. Image: Getty
