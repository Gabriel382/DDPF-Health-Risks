Zhang Weili questions Joanna Jedrzejczyk's character for joking about coronavirus 
 Joanna Jedrzejczyk took an insensitive jab at Zhang Weili that she appears to have instantly regretted.

In her Instagram story, Jedrzejczyk posted an image of herself standing behind UFC strawweight champion Weili while wearing a gas mask, implying that she is protecting herself from the possibility of catching the coronavirus, which is currently at the center of a deadly outbreak in China. Jedrzejczyk later deleted the post.

The current coronavirus outbreak first appeared in Wuhan in the beginning of December and has since claimed the lives of over 130 people in Weili’s native China. The virus is continuing to spread, with over 6,000 confirmed cases so far.

In a classy manner, Weili took to Instagram to respond to Jedrzejczyk, politely asking her to divert the focus of any jabs directly to her, as opposed to a deadly virus, a matter she said shouldn’t be at the center of any jokes.

“To make fun of tragedy is a true sign of ones character. People are dying, someones father, someones mother, someones child. Say what you want about me if it makes you feel stronger but do not joke about what’s happening here. I wish you good health until March 7th. I will see you soon.”

Weili is set to make her first title defense on March 7, when she takes on Jedrzejczyk in the co-main event of UFC 248 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
