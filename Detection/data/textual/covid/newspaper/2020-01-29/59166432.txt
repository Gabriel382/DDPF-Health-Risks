Americans Evacuate China, Land In California As Coronavirus Continues To Spread 
 A flight carrying 201 American passengers landed Wednesday morning at a military base in California after stopping for health checks in Anchorage, Alaska.
 Health officials screened the group for coronavirus in China, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screened the passengers again at a stop in Alaska, according to The Associated Press.
 
 All passengers passed their screenings upon landing at March Air Reserve Base in Southern California and will continue to have health checks while in temporary housing. The base is about 65 miles from Los Angeles. (RELATED: CDC Confirms Wuhan Coronavirus Case In Chicago As China Locks Down Travel In More Cities)
