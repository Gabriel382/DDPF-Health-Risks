Coronavirus symptoms: what to look for and how to treat it 
 China’s mystery new coronavirus is spreading fast. More than 6,000 people are known to be infected and at least 132 deaths have been recorded.

The bulk of cases have been confined to China but the virus is gradually spreading further afield. So far cases have been confirmed in more than 13 countries, including France, Germany, Australia and the United States.

At least 100 people have been tested in the United Kingdom and Public Health England (PHE) think it “likely” the virus will soon be discovered here, though all tests have been negative to date.

Experts have been warning for years that the world is long overdue a major disease outbreak, but there is much individuals can do to avoid becoming infected.

This practical guide is designed to keep you safe and will be updated daily. It is underpinned with advice from leading experts from the NHS and beyond.
