This year, Apple had an ambitious plan to spike up its production by 10 percent, however, this plan has come across a rather terrible halt due to the coronavirus outbreak. As per reports by Nikkei, Apple had asked its suppliers to manufacture 80 million iPhones in the first half of 2020.
From the 80 million, 65 million units would include the older iPhone, whereas the remaining 15 million would have a new lower-priced model that the Cupertino giant is expected to unveil sometime in March, this year, which could be the iPhone SE 2 that we have been hearing a lot about in the past.
This production was scheduled to commence by the third week of February, however, that is expected to get delayed due to the lockdown by Chinese authorities due to the Wuhan Coronavirus.

 Oddly enough, Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn doesn’t feel that there will be any delay in meeting the production targets. It said in a statement to the Verge, "We can confirm that we have measures in place to ensure that we can continue to meet all global manufacturing obligations."

The response further added, "Foxconn is closely monitoring the current public health challenge linked to the coronavirus and we are applying all recommended health and hygiene practices to all aspects of our operations in the affected markets. Our facilities in China are following holiday schedules and will continue to do so until all businesses have resumed standard operating hours."
