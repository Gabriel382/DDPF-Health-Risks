U.S. equity markets opened higher Tuesday as traders digested a number of high-profile corporate earnings results and looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision.

Dow components Apple, Boeing, Dow and McDonald’s released their quarterly results.

Boeing reported a $1.01 billion loss in the fourth quarter and its first annual loss in 22 years as the planemaker continued to reel from the grounding of its best-selling 737 Max aircraft.

Chemical maker Dow reported better-than-expected results, helped by strong demand in Asia and cost cuts.
