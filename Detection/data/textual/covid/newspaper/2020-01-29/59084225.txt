Locsin says China vowed to keep coronavirus matters transparent 
 MANILA, Philippines—China has vowed for transparency on reports concerning the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV outbreak that has already claimed the lives of over a hundred people.

This was among the results of a recent meeting between Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretaries Meynardo Montealegre and Neil Frank Ferrer, and Chinese Consul General Luo Gang, according to Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.

In a tweet Wednesday, Locsin said that China is “implementing all measures to stop the spread of the virus” and that repatriation will only aid its spread.

The top diplomat also said that China assured sufficient food supply and medical assistance for all including foreigners in their country.

With over 6,000 confirmed cases and over a hundred deaths, the outbreak of the new coronavirus strain has already caused global alarm, prompting countries to beef up precautionary measures to avoid their contamination.

The virus has already reached several countries such as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United States, Nepal, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia.

Most of the confirmed cases were recorded in the central Chinese province of Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, where several cities, including Wuhan, have been placed under lockdown.

There is still no confirmed case of novel coronavirus infection in the Philippines but the health officials are closely monitoring 23 patients, all of whom are foreigners after showing symptoms of flu.
