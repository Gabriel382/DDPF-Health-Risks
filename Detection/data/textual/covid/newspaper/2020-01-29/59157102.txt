Fed keeps interest rates steady, maintains wait-and-see approach 
 Former Dallas Fed adviser Danielle DiMartino Booth and Axios markets editor Dion Rabouin discuss how the Federal Reserve's interest rates and the recent trade deals could impact the U.S. economy.




The Federal Reserve voted unanimously to hold interest rates steady during its first policy meeting of the year on Wednesday, reaffirming its wait-and-see approach despite growing concerns about China's widening coronavirus outbreak.
In a move that was widely expected, the Federal Open Market Committee, during its two-day meeting this week, kept the benchmark federal funds rate on hold at a range between 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent.
“Fed guidance has been that future decisions will be data-dependent, as always," Tony Bedikian, head of global markets at Citizens Bank, said. "The consensus seems to be that the Fed is on pause for the time being as policymakers have achieved a balance between low unemployment and moderate inflation in a slow, steady growth environment.”
Still, some economists noted the rapidly spreading coronavirus — more than 130 people have died from the mysterious illness, while Chinese officials confirmed more than 6,000 cases — had emerged as an unexpected risk to the global economy. Multiple companies and countries are limiting travel to and from mainland China, evacuating citizens and scaling back operations, raising concerns about the health of the world's second-largest economy.
"We maintain our view that the Fed will cut rates once more in 2020," Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said. "For now, we maintain our view that this rate cut will come in March, as firms become increasingly concerned about the impact of coronavirus on a major growth market, China."
