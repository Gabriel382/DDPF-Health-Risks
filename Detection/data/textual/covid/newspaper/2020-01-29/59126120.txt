India's Biggest Airlines Suspend Operation to China Amid Coronavirus 
 Hours after India’s biggest airline IndiGo announced the suspension of its services to China, the country's national carrier Air India on Wednesday, also announced the suspension of service to the Coronavirus-hit country for the next 15 days.

Air India will not be operating flights to China from 31 January to 14 February and IndiGo flights will also remain suspended from February 1 to February 20.

​In a statement, the private carrier IndiGo said it is temporarily suspending flights to China's city of Chengdu from Delhi as well as the Bengaluru-Hong Kong flight.

In the wake of an outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, India’s Health Ministry has also issued a travel advisory requiring the screening of international travellers from China and those who have visited the country. It has also asked designated airports to monitor passengers.

The Indian government has organised all logistics support and made arrangements to screen air passengers in cities including Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Cochin, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.
