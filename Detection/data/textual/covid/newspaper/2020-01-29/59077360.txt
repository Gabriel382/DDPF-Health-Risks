All Brits returning from coronavirus-hit city to be held at army base 
 Any Brits returning from coronavirus-hit Wuhan will be held at an army base, government sources have said.

This comes after British Airways suspended all flights to and from mainland China in response to the outbreak, which originated in Wuhan.

All Brits coming back from the city of 11m people will be placed in quarantine for 14 days, the Department of Health said.

There are around 200 British nationals thought to be in Wuhan at the moment.

Officials will then look to take the passengers to a military base once they arrive home, it said.

A flight is due to leave Wuhan bound for the UK tomorrow.

Passengers may be asked to sign a contract before they board the plane saying they agree to being placed in quarantine.

Anyone who doesn't wish to sign could be banned from boarding the plane.

It is the latest measure taken by a national government to try and contain the spread of coronavirus.

Americans evacuated from China will undergo screening in Alaska before quarantine, health authorities in the US reported today.

A chartered plane carrying more than 200 Americans from Wuhan landed in Anchorage shortly after 9.20pm local time on Tuesday.

All 240 passengers, including diplomats, were sent for screening at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.

The plane was also due to be refueled before flying on to March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, California.

Jim Szczesniak, airport manager, said the aircraft would be "handled in a remote location," and that medical staff from the United States Centers for Disease Control would check patients in an isolated area.

The passengers would stay in the unused terminal, Szczesniak said.
