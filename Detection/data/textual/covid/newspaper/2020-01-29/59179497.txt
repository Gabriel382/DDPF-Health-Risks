US stocks on Monday dropped the most since October as fear surrounding the Wuhan virus prompted rotation from risk assets to safe havens. The outbreak's death toll sits at 132 people, with more than 6,000 infected around the world, according to China's National Health Commission.The virus' rapid spreading around the world has been "violently" reflected in global markets, Shah said in a Monday statement. Risk velocity — the speed at which major risks and "black swan" events affect asset values — is higher today compared to 10 years ago and far more pronounced than during the SARS outbreak, Shah added. Other analysts balk at the comparison between SARS and the Wuhan virus. Using the 2003 pandemic as a benchmark is "useless," RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Porcelli said in a Monday note, adding that the onset of the Iraq War and a weaker economic backdrop formed a vastly different context when SARS hit global markets.Here are the three reasons why risk velocity has risen over the past decade, according to Shah, and why coronavirus news tanked markets so quickly.
