Minneapolis-St. Paul airport to screen for coronavirus 
 Travelers will be screened for a novel coronavirus at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, along with 14 other airports, as health officials race to contain the spread of a virus that started in China but has now appeared in more than 60 countries.


                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
                        
                                                                                        Federal health officials announced the heightened airport screening on Tuesday along with new recommendations against nonessential travel to China, where the rapidly spreading virus has killed more than 130 people and infected nearly 6,000.


                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
                        
                                                                                        While China has shut down flights out of Wuhan, the epicenter of the viral outbreak, health officials said some travelers had been in that region and then traveled to other locations before coming to the U.S.

Testing has ruled out 32 suspected cases, including two from Minnesota.

Medical personnel have the authority at these stations to detain anyone who appears through screening to be at risk for carrying a serious infectious disease. CDC officials at these stations can then deny the at-risk travelers entry into the U.S. or isolate them in hospitals or at their homes to reduce the risk of spreading any infectious disease to others.

In addition to asking questions and taking the temperatures of people returning from China, Messonnier said the screeners will educate the travelers about what to do if they develop symptoms once back home.

The director of the CDC station there, Dr. Arnold Vang, said he had not been given permission from his agency to discuss activities there.

The resident of Superior, Wis., had just returned from a two-month business trip to the coastal China city of Zhuhai.

Even so, the situation there remains "very calm."

A passenger from China was on her plane and sanitized his seat and tray before takeoff, she said. Garrard said she also met a man at the San Francisco airport who had to pay thousands of dollars to fly from China to the U.S. for his father's funeral.

"We're going to Italy later this spring, and we hope it's blown over by then."

Some researchers have concluded that it is much less contagious than measles but can spread about as easily as seasonal influenza viruses.
