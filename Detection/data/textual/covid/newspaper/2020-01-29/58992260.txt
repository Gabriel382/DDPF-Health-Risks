Coronavirus: British Airways suspends bookings for China flights as outbreak spreads 
 British Airways has suspended bookings on its website for direct flights from London to Beijing and Shanghai as the coronavirus outbreak spreads.

The airline's website shows no direct flights to China are available in January or February. According to reports, a spokesperson for British Airways said the airline is "assessing the situation".

On Tuesday evening cases of coronavirus overtook the total of Sars cases in 2003-04, with the number of deaths reaching 131 and 5,974 cases confirmed.

The Foreign Office responded by urging Britons not to travel to China. British holidaymakers are being advised to avoid "all but essential" travel to the Chinese mainland while Beijing imposes stricter freedoms on movement.

The warning also said that British nationals in China should "consider making plans to do so before any further restrictions may be imposed". Only Hong Kong and Macao are exempt from the advice.

Earlier in the week British researchers calculated that London is at greater risk from coronavirus than any other city in Europe, and warned cases are likely to emerge in the coming weeks.

Cases of the virus have now been reported in 15 countries, including the US, Germany and France.
