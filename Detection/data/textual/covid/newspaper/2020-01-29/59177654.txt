Dutton defends Christmas Island virus plan 
 The minister responsible for the nation's borders has defended the government's plan to transfer Australians from the Chinese city at the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus to Christmas Island.

Peter Dutton has responded to criticism about the plan, saying people evacuated there would have access to medical treatment while under quarantine at the detention centre for 14 days.

"I can't clear a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to accommodate 600 people. We don't have a facility otherwise that can take this number of people," he told Nine's Today program on Thursday.
