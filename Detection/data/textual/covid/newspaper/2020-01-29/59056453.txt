ABL to hold closed-door games amid virus outbreak 
 Putting premium on everyone’s safety amid the novel coronavirus outbreak, the Asean Basketball League on Wednesday announced that a pair of games will be played behind closed doors.

Games featuring the Macau Black Bears and Kuala Lumpur Dragons in Macao scheduled Wednesday night and the Singapore Slingers against Hong Kong Eastern in Hong Kong on Friday will be played without fans.

“In line with the upgraded emergency levels of the governments of Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR due to the Coronavirus, the games scheduled on 29 January 2020 between the Macau Black Bears and the Kuala Lumpur Dragons, and on 31 January 2020 between the Hong Kong Eastern and Singapore Slingers will be played behind closed doors,” the ABL said in a statement.

“The league and its teams primary priority is the utmost safety of everyone – both participants and fans.”

Recent reports cited that there are already more than 6,000 confirmed cases of the new virus, which has spread to more than 15 countries since it originated in Wuhan, China late last year, with the death toll soaring to 132.

“Preventive safety measures will be enforced – only people who have pre-registered can enter the venue and would be required to present their pass upon arrival. The venue will be disinfected before it will be opened to players, staff, officials, and other personnel. Everyone who are allowed to enter the venue will be temperature checked and offered a mask, if needed. Sanitizers will also be available at all times in various locations in the arena,” the league said.

The ABL also said purchased tickets can be refunded and that the said games will still be broadcasted live.

“We will keep the situation under close review, and further enhance the precautionary measures, if necessary. We would like to extend our sincerest apologies to everyone for the inconvenience this has caused.”
