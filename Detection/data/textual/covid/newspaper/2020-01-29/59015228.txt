CEE MARKETS-Forint stabilises after month of declines 
 BUDAPEST, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The forint stabilised on Wednesday, within sight of its all-time lows, at the tail end of a month of declines as global worries over the spread of the coronavirus added to pressure from Hungary's loose monetary policy. At 0907 GMT, the forint was 0.2% stronger at 337.8 against the euro. It has shed about 2% this year, underperforming its central European peers as the National Bank of Hungary maintains a loose monetary policy despite strong domestic inflation. The currency hit an all-time low at 338.77 per euro on Monday. Central Europe's most dovish central bank left interest rates unchanged on Tuesday but warned China's virus outbreak could hurt global growth prospects. "The forint is ambling around in the 337-339 range. Yesterday's rate decision did not provide any new guidance, not that anyone had expected it to," a Budapest-based currency dealer said. "On the whole, positioning is such that there is not much room for further long positions in the euro. Even if the forint were to weaken to 339 or 340, there will be some profit-taking at those levels, which can stem the falls," he said. The trader added, however, that worries over the spread of the coronavirus dented global market sentiment and strengthened the dollar, which is generally negative for emerging markets. "This slightly sour mood can prevail this week," the trader said. Tatha Ghose, an economist at Commerzbank said, however, that the central bank's loose policy stance would continue to weigh on the forint. "Since the CB maintains the most expansionary monetary stance in the whole EM universe (the most negative real rate) and will only review policy after its next Inflation Report in March, this understandably makes the FX market very nervous," he said. "The deep negative real interest rate will likely continue to exert its erosive effect on the forint's valuation. We see upside for EUR-HUF from current levels."
