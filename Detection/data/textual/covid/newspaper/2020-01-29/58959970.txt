Brazilian child in Puerto Princesa tests negative for Wuhan coronavirus 
 MANILA - A Brazilian child who had flu-like symptoms in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan tested negative for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the provincial disaster management office said Wednesday.

The 10-year-old boy and his parents were quarantined at the Ospital ng Palawan on Jan. 24 after manifesting symptoms following a recent trip to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the new strain of virus.

While the parents had no fever, their child had to be confined after showing such symptoms as difficulty in breathing and fever.

The Health department on Wednesday said it was monitoring 27 foreigners for suspected infection of the new coronavirus, that has already killed 132 in China and infected 5,974 others.

The figure has surpassed the number of people affected in China by the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003.

The Philippines has since stopped issuing tourist visas on arrival to Chinese nationals as precautionary measure.
