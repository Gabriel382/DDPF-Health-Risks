Victorian virus case family awaits results 
 A Victorian resident in his 60s has become infected while travelling in China's Hubei province

Results are pending for four of the five relatives who had dinner with the man confirmed to be the second person testing positive for the deadly coronavirus in Victoria.

The state's health department confirmed on Wednesday evening that a man in his 60s had become infected while travelling in China's Hubei province.

The department said the man started to feel unwell on January 23 and had remained isolated since then, but he had dinner with his family on Australia Day.

The Victorian resident visited The House Of Delight restaurant in Glen Waverley with his five family members between 5.30pm and 7pm on January 26.

Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Brett Sutton urged anyone who was at the restaurant during this time to be aware of symptoms.

But he also sent a message of caution.

"That restaurant is OK to go to now, people don't need to avoid the area or indeed anywhere else," he said.

The man's three adult and two child relatives have been isolated with him. One has already tested negative for the virus, while the children are being kept from school.

Up to 14 people in Victoria await results of their tests, while another 61 have tested negative.

The second case in Victoria, along with Queensland's first case confirmed on Wednesday evening, raised the national count to seven.

Australia's Chief Medical Officer is now recommending anyone who has travelled in the Hubei province to self-isolate for 14 days after leaving the Hubei province.
