Airports in the region and the Khamis Mushait base were also targeted, Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said on television.

Jazan is the site of a 400,000 barrel-a-day Aramco (SE:) refinery but the city, near the border with Yemen, isn’t home to crude oil production facilities or major export terminals. The Jazan refinery and petrochemical complex isn’t yet operating at its full capacity, but is expected to do so in the second half of 2020, Aramco said at the time of its initial public offering last year.

The price jump added to a broader recovery in commodities prices as traders assessed the impact of China’s coronavirus outbreak on the demand for raw materials. While the number of confirmed infections in China has overtaken the official number recorded during the 2003 SARS epidemic, it’s still unclear how severely world oil consumption will be affected.
