Coronavirus: People from China must be under strict surveillance – MP to govt 
 The Member of Parliament for Daffiama, Bussie, Issa Constituencies, Sebastian Ngmenenso Sandaare has said that government must put in strict measures to ensure that Ghanaians are not exposed to corona virus.

 

 According to him, people who arrive into the country must be on a frequent surveillance aside the regular checkup since the symptoms of the virus comes later after contracting the virus.

 

 Speaking in an interview on measures to avoid the spread of the virus in the country, the MP said government should not take the spread of disease lightly as symptoms are usually detected after the carrier has infected another person.

 

 “What is unusual about this particular virus is that unlike SARS which once you show symptoms, spreading starts…this one we understand that you can infect others even before the symptoms begin to show which makes it very serious.”

 

 He noted the necessity to monitor people who enter the country form China even days after their arrival.

 

 “This means that people can come in without really showing the symptoms but it’s good to have the list of all those coming in especially those from China so that we can track and continuously monitor them so that measures are taken to prevent the spread of diseases if you are infected,” he suggested.
