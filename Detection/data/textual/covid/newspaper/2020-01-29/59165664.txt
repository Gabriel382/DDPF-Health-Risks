Britons on Wuhan flights to be quarantined – as BA suspends all direct flights to and from China 
 “The whole world needs to be on alert” the World Health Organisation warned today as it announced that it will reconvene the committee that decides whether to declare a global health emergency.

The coronavirus outbreak has continued to grow, but officials say they still believe that it can be halted.

Meanwhile the UK government has unveiled plans to bring back Britons stranded in China, but they’ll have to agree to spend two weeks in quarantine here on their return.
