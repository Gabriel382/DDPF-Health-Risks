Wuhan Coronavirus: Multiple People At YVR Seen With Jugs On Their Head (PHOTOS) 
 Vancouver recently confirmed its first case of the coronavirus, a man in his 40s who recently visited Wuhan, China. And as fears of the virus spread, people are taking on new levels of precautionary measures.

While surgical masks are selling out across Vancouver, others have decided to get crafty by wearing plastic jugs on their head. (Fans of Riverdale will undoubtedly call these people Jughead.)

A woman who recently visited YVR Airport took photos of people donning the plastic headgear. That includes one woman who even cut out a hole in the back for her ponytail.

Carter shared the photo to Facebook and has since gone viral.

She, among others, shared more images of people donning the new plastic shields.

But the World Health Organization has said Canadians are at a low risk of contracting the virus.

And the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention offers no advice for wearing containers on your head to prevent infection.

Instead they offer the usual advice for prevention. That includes washing your hands, to cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing and to avoid being too close to people who are sick.

But the question is, where did this advice come from? If you’re unsure, here’s what you need to know about the illness.
