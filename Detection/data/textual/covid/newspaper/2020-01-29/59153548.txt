Plane Evacuating US Nationals From Wuhan Arrives at California Military Base 
 A chartered plane carrying US evacuees, including diplomatic staff, from the coronavirus-hit city of Wuhan, China, landed at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California, on January 29. The flight, operated by Kalitta Air, left Wuhan on January 28. It stopped in Anchorage, Alaska, to refuel. Passengers will be screened after leaving the aircraft to “ensure these people can get back home and not put anyone at risk,” according to Dr Cameron Kaiser, the public health officer for Riverside County. When announcing the evacuation flight, the US State Department said that capacity was extremely limited and if there was insufficient ability to transport everyone who expressed interest, priority would be given to individuals at greater risk from the virus.
