Coronavirus Outbreak Disrupts Many Int'l Sports Events 
 The sports world, especially in Asia, is being hit by the coronavirus outbreak, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan and is spreading rapidly in and outside of the country.

Several international fixtures scheduled to take place in China have been canceled or moved, while sports clubs are hurrying to bring athletes training in Chinese cities back home.

The Asian Athletics Association on Tuesday announced the cancellation of the Asian Indoor Athletics Championships, which had been scheduled to take place in Hangzhou on Feb. 12-13, and it is unclear whether the World Athletics Indoor Championships will be held as scheduled in March in Nanjing, some 500 km from Wuhan. World Athletics said it is "monitoring this situation carefully and is in close contact with the World Health Organization."

The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) has moved the FIBA Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament from China's Foshan to Belgrade, Serbia, which will be held from Feb. 6 to 9. Korea is grouped together with China, Spain and the U.K., and the relocation will make it harder for Korean players to maintain their physical condition, as they will now face a long-haul flight and jet lag.

Other Olympic qualifying events have also been relocated, with women's football events moving from Nanjing to Sydney, Australia and boxing from Wuhan to Amman, Jordan.

The deadly virus has also disrupted Korean football clubs' training in Chinese cities. Sangju Sangmu FC players cut short their training in Meizhou and returned home on Monday, 10 days earlier than scheduled. Daegu FC canceled training sessions in Shanghai, which had been due to start on Thursday.
