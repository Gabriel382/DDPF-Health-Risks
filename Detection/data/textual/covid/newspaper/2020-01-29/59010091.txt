GUTA advises members to suspend trip to China 
 The Ghana Union of Traders Association is advising members of the business community, particularly traders who intend or are preparing to China for business or any other thing to hold on.

 

 It rather encourages the possibility of transacting business and other communication via the internet until the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control.

 

 In a statement, GUTA, said: “For those who have recently returned or are returning from a trip to China and its environs should carefully observe themselves and report to the nearest facility immediately they start feeling any symptom of the disease as stated by health officials, for early diagnosis and treatment.”

 

 It therefore urged the business community to listen and comply with the directives issued by the health authorities in Ghana

 

 “It is our prayer that no trader is affected by the virus”, it concluded.

 

 Many members of GUTA travel to China daily to transact business.

 

 So far, no Ghanaian has been reported to have been infected by the coronavirus.
