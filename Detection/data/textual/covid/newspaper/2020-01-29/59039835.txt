Chinese Kobe Bryant fan says he'd rather thousands die of coronavirus 
 A Chinese basketball fan has been jailed for seven days for saying he'd rather see the coronavirus 'spread and kill thousands' than Kobe Bryant die in a helicopter crash.

The fan, named only as Mr Han, was arrested in Xuzhou after China's strict Internet police saw a message he'd sent in a group chat on WeChat, the country's most popular messaging app.

He sent the message on Monday, a day after LA Lakers legend Kobe, 41, and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna died along with seven others when their helicopter crashed in Calabasas, California.

Mr Han reportedly wrote: 'I would rather see the virus spread and kill thousands than read of Kobe's death.'

Authorities in the city of Xuzhou, in East China's Zhejiang Province, said he was arrested for public order offences after other WeChat users reported his message.

Xuzhou internet police said the message was deemed 'inappropriate' and that his comment 'caused a negative impact on society'. He was given a seven-day detention sentence.

Some 132 people have now died across China and more than 6,000 around the world have caught the highly infectious pneumonia-like infection, with cases having risen dramatically in the past week.
