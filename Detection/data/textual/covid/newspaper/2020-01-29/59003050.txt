Australia's epidemic 'preparedness' is at the 'global forefront': Greg Hunt 
 Health Minister Greg Hunt says the federal government’s measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus is “sensible and prudent” with “public health and public safety” as the “number one priority”. Prime Minister Scott Morrison addressed the virus in his speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday announcing precautionary measures such as the issuing of up to a million face masks, and an expected 14-day quarantine on Christmas Island for Australians returning from Wuhan. Mr Hunt told Sky News host Peta Credlin the World Health Organisation reviewed Australia’s “epidemic preparedness” in 2018 and ranked Australia “at the global forefront”. The federal government formally declared coronavirus as a “disease with potential pandemic proportions,” he said. Mr Hunt said Australians who are planning to travel to China in the near future should “reconsider that travel”. Image: Getty
