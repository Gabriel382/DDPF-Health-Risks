Toronto family's relative living in Wuhan refused treatment for coronavirus-like symptoms 
 The fears many have had about the state of the coronavirus in China are being shared in the harrowing experience of one Toronto family that has an ill relative living in Wuhan.

Sha Jiang tells 680NEWS four of her relatives live in the city where the outbreak first began, and her aunt is believed to have contracted the virus.

After experiencing flu-like symptoms including a fever and even shortness of breath, Jiang’s aunt went to a hospital but was refused treatment because of how busy the health centre was.

With hospitals described as being ‘overcrowded’ and hospitals workers being ‘overwhelmed’, Jiang and her husband say people being denied treatment is becoming a new normal – especially if their condition or symptoms aren’t as severe.

The Toronto family says with much of China under lockdown to help keep the virus from spreading, they’re now left feeling helpless – knowing they can’t go there or even send anything through the mail to help their family members who continue to struggle.

All they’re doing now is trying to keep frequent communication with their family to help keep them calm.

But, this story comes in contrast from what officials with the World Health Organization said in an update on Wednesday, when they praised China for responding the right way to the virus.

As of Wednesday, there were more than 6,000 confirmed coronavirus infections and 132 fatalities.
