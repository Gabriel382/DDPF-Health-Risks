Coronavirus protection: What precautions should you take? 
 India is closely monitoring the threat posed by a new flu-like virus that has killed dozens of people in China, and has asked citizens to "refrain from travelling" there.

The health ministry has published an exhaustive list of guidelines for Indian citizens travelling in and returning from China.

Travellers in China who feel sick should suspend further travel, see a doctor immediately and contact the Indian embassy at +8618612083629 or +8618612083617.

Indians feeling sick within a month of returning from China should isolate themselves from others, get medical attention and follow good hand and respiratory hygiene. They should call the helpline number 011-23978046 and follow directions.

The World Health Organisation has a list of recommendations for protection against several illnesses, including the new strain of coronavirus. Here is a useful infographic from the UN body. [More details available here.]
