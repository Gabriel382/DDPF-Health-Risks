China's national women's soccer team quarantined in Brisbane hotel amid coronavirus fears 
 The team is in Australia to play in an Olympic qualifying tournament, which had originally been due to be staged in Wuhan in China.

But as the Wuhan coronavirus spread across Asia and the rest of the world, the tournament was moved to Nanjing in China and then Sydney. At least 132 people are dead and more than 6,000 cases have been confirmed in mainland China.

The Chinese women's team had flown to Brisbane in Queensland, Australia ahead of playing in the Sydney tournament, but is now being held at their hotel.

"We are working closely with the hotel and the 32 individuals concerned -- who are all well and not showing symptoms -- and we have Queensland Heath staff present at the hotel," said Dr. Jeannette Young, Chief Health Officer at Queensland Health.
