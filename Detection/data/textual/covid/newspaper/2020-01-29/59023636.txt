2 of Japanese evacuees from China's Wuhan develop pneumonia 
 TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Two of the Japanese citizens evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan on Wednesday were found to have developed pneumonia after being hospitalized in Tokyo, the metropolitan government said.

A government-chartered plane brought home the first group of 206 people from the city at the center of a deadly virus outbreak early in the morning.

The two male patients in their 40s and 50s are among five who were sent to hospitals due to symptoms including a fever or cough. Authorities are testing the five for infection with the new coronavirus.
