NEW YORK: Health officials on Tuesday reported what appear to be the first known cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus in Germany and in Japan . Another case was recently reported in Vietnam . The cases show that countries across the world are now faced with the task of limiting the spread of the disease on their own soil, not just seeking to identify and quarantine ailing patients who had travelled from China.Japan’s ministry of health, labour and welfare said the first Japanese national — and the sixth person in Japan overall — to be diagnosed with the coronavirus was a man in his 60s. He had never been to Wuhan , but he had worked as a bus driver earlier this month for two different group tours from that city, officials said. The man began experiencing symptoms on January 14 and was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Tuesday.The infected German, whose case was also confirmed on Tuesday, is a 33-yearold man from Bavaria who had been in contact with a Chinese woman in Germany, officials said. The woman was diagnosed with the virus after flying home to China. The man was in good condition, German officials said. “It was to be expected that the virus would come to Germany,” Jens Spahn , Germany’s health minister, said in a statement on Tuesday.The WHO said on Friday that there appeared to have been a case of human-to-human transmission in Vietnam. The person had never been to China, but had a relative who had visited Wuhan, and was confirmed to have the virus.
