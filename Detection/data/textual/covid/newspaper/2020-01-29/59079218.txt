Govt response to coronavirus has been 'pretty meek and mild' 
 Sky News contributor Caleb Bond says the government's response to the deadly coronavirus threat has been "pretty meek and mild". The federal government has unveiled plans to rescue Australians stranded in China's Hubei province where the coronavirus first emerged. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday said the operation - to be carried out in cooperation with the New Zealand government - would target "isolated and vulnerable" Australians. Mr Morrison said the government was establishing a quarantine zone on Christmas Island in preparation for the evacuees where people would remain on the island and undergo testing for an estimated 14 days. "I don't think we realised, or the government certainly didn't realise, exactly how dangerous this could be on the ground here," Mr Bond told Sky News host Peter Gleeson. "It seems like one hell of a virus," he said. Image: Associated Press
