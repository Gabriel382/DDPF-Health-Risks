Our man in Wuhan
Chris Buckley, our chief China correspondent, is reporting this week from the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Mike Ives, on the Briefings team, spoke with him by phone.
What is it like with these restrictions in place?
It may be difficult to envisage just how thoroughly people have retreated from the streets and from public life. I had to cross one of the big bridges across the Yangtze for my reporting. And there I was, on one of these Chinese share bikes that are everywhere, on an almost completely empty bridge, spanning one of China’s biggest cities, crossing its biggest river. And there were just two other people on the bridge.
A lot of people wonder how long the shutdown can last. Even now, people are worrying about the jobs they may lose, the businesses that will close, the school that they might miss.
You’ve reported that the anger on Chinese social media is intense.
Yes, and you hear that here as well. People erupt with a kind of anger and exasperation over how it was that this dangerous pathogen was among them but they didn’t understand, in many cases, how serious it was or what was going on until the city was shut down.
