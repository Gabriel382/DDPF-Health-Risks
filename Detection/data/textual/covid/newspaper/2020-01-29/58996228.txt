Coronavirus: British Airways stop all flights to China after Foreign Office warning 
 The move comes after the Foreign Office warned against all but essential travel to the country at the centre of the health alert. The BA website shows no direct flights to China are available in January and February. The carrier usually operates daily flights to Shanghai and Beijing from Heathrow.

A BA spokesman said: “We apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority.
"Customers due to travel to or from China in the coming days can find more information on BA.com."
The Foreign Office updated its travel guidance yesterday to advise against "all but essential" travel to mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said officials are "working urgently to finalise arrangements for an assisted departure from Hubei Province for British nationals this week, and are in contact with people in Hubei to ensure they register their interest and that we can keep them updated".
He said: "Due to the increasing travel restrictions and the public health situation, we now advise against all but essential travel to China."
Officials said UK nationals in China should "make decisions based on their own personal circumstances" over whether to leave other parts of the country.

Culture Secretary Baroness Morgan said BA's decision to suspend all flights to China would give "more impetus" to the Government's bid to arrange for Britons to travel home.
She said: “The Foreign Office will be working with staff on the ground to identify UK nationals.
“We will get people home as soon as we can, as soon as we can make arrangements.
“Obviously, today's decision by British Airways provides more impetus to the Government to make other plans and communicate those.
“The health system is well prepared. We are not aware of any confirmed cases of the virus here in the UK but we do have the expertise to look after people, to treat and to test should that become necessary.”
