Evangelical pastor claims coronavirus is God’s ‘death angel’ to ‘purge a lot of sin’ 
 An evangelical pastor is claiming the coronavirus is God’s “death angel” seeking justice for those “transgendering little children” and putting “filth” on TVs and movies.

Christian Pastor Rick Wiles told his TruNews web show viewers to not “get into crazy, whacked-out theories” about what he warned could be a “global pandemic” that kills “hundreds of millions of people.”

He then suggested the virus started in China because of the “godless communist government that persecutes Christians” and “forced abortions” — and said the “death angel” could have eyes on the US.

“God is about to purge a lot of sin off of this planet,” Wiles told his viewers on Monday.

“Look at the United States, look at the spiritual rebellion in this country — the hatred of God, the hatred of the Bible, the hatred of righteousness,” he raged.

“There are vile, disgusting people in this country now, transgendering little children, perverting them. Look at the rapes, and the sexual immorality, and the filth on our TVs and our movies.

“Folks, the Death Angel may be moving right now across the planet. This is the time to get right with God,” he said.

Wiles said he was enforcing his own self-quarantine — only going from home to his Flowing Streams Church in Florida — and suggested governments could end up “incinerating” whole cities to end the “plague.”

“You’re about to be shocked what Governments will do for survival,” he insisted.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China has reached 5,974 — surpassing the 5,327 in mainland China from SARS — and has killed more than 130 people.
