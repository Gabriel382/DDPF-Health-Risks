Tesla does it again, stock soars 
 Citron Research founder discusses the impact coronavirus will have on U.S. markets, Tesla’s value as an automotive company, and his outlook for Peloton stock.  




Tesla CEO Elon Musk has delivered another blow to his doubters calling "2019 a turning point for Tesla."
The electric car maker posted fourth-quarter revenue of $7.38 billion and net income, excluding items of $2.06 per share, both topped expectations. Cash on hand rose to $6.3 billion.
"For most of 2019, nearly all orders came from new buyers that did not hold a prior reservation, demonstrating significant reach beyond those who showed early interest. Amazingly, this was accomplished without any spend on advertising" the company stated in its update.
