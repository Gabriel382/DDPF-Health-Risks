Chinese soccer team quarantined in Brisbane hotel amid coronavirus fears 
 Queensland health officials have revealed the Chinese Women's National soccer team is being quarantined in Brisbane over concerns about the possible spread of coronavirus.

No cases of the virus have been recorded in Queensland so far.

The state's chief health officer, Jeannette Young, said 32 people — including the team and other staff — travelled from the city of Wuhan one week ago and as a result, they have been placed in isolation in a Brisbane hotel.

Dr Young said authorities were working with the team and the hotel's management to ensure the visitors remained separated from staff and other guests.

Meanwhile, the Queensland Education Department has also issued new advice for any students or staff who have travelled to China in the past 14 days to keep themselves isolated and not return to school for 14 days.

More to come.
