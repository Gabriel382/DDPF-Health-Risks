Coronavirus: British Airways suspends all flights to mainland China 
 British Airways has suspended flights between the United Kingdom and China in light of the Coronavirus outbreak, CNN reports.

This was made known in a statement released by the airline on Wednesday morning.

The airline, which operates daily flights to Shanghai and Beijing from Heathrow, said it was halting the flights with immediate effect after the Foreign Office warned against ‘all but essential travel’ to the country because of the virus outbreak.

The statement read “We have suspended all flights to and from mainland China with immediate effect following advice from the Foreign Office against all but essential travel.

‘We apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority.

”Customers due to travel to or from China in the coming days can find more information on ba.com.”
