 (adds ‘Social’ to name of think tank in headline, 2nd paragraph) 
BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China’s economic growth may drop to 5% or even lower in the first quarter as the coronavirus hits more sectors, possibly leading policymakers to introduce more stimulus measures, a government economist said in remarks published on Wednesday 
The outbreak could cut first-quarter GDP growth by about 1 percentage point, Zhang Ming, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - a top government think tank - said in a report published in Caijing magazine. 
Zhang’s forecasts are based on the assumption that outbreak will peak in early to mid-February, and end by the end of March.
