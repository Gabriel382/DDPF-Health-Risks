The 2019 novel coronavirus was originally thought to be spreading from animal to person, but there are growing indications that limited person-to-person spread is occurring.Outbreaks of novel virus infections are public health concerns. The possible risk of 2019-nCoV infections in South Carolina depends on multiple factors, including the likelihood of travelers from affected areas, how easily the virus may spread from person to person and others of which are still unknown with 2019-nCoV. Although the potential of human-to-human spread raises the level of concern in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believes the risk to the American public remains low at this time.How CDC and DHEC are working togetherCDC has been proactively preparing for the introduction of 2019-nCoV in the United States for weeks, including alerting clinicians about how to detect, report and diagnose 2019-nCoV and prevent spread and providing guidance for travelers.As the state’s lead public health and environmental agency, DHEC is taking proactive steps to be prepared for potential cases in South Carolina, including remaining updated on and following the latest CDC recommendations related to surveillance, evaluation, and response.For more information, visit the CDC’s 2019 Novel Coronavirus webpage.For more on frequently asked questions, click here. Prisma Health sent us the following statement about their procedures: "Prisma Health has robust biopreparedness plans already in place to handle novel disease outbreaks and will continue to ensure these plans and associated procedures are up-to-date based on current CDC guidance. Prisma Health has already added coronavirus-specific travel screening questions to the patient intake process and provided additional guidance to front-line team members in its Emergency Departments and physician practices throughout the state on how to respond to suspected cases. As a precaution, it’s also ramped up its stockpile of supplies such as gowns, respirator masks and face shields."Prisma Health epidemiologists said there’s no current evidence to suggest that the virus will reach epidemic proportions in the U.S. As precaution, however, they ask that individuals with symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and travel to China or exposure to known coronavirus patient go to a nearby medical facility for assessment. Those individuals are asked to call ahead to notify the facility so that correct infection prevention measures can be in place from the time they arrive, including potentially masking them while they’re still in their vehicles."
