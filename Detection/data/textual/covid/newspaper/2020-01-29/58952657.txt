Bizmen fear losses after corona virus outbreak in China | Ludhiana News - Times of India 
 Ludhiana: The outbreak of corona virus in China has dented business prospects of some local businessmen, who are frequent travellers to that country for importing goods from that country. A variety of goods, including electronics, sanitary products, rubber products, etc. are imported in huge numbers from China here every month. Spreading of this epidemic has not only put brakes on the travel plans of businessmen to China but at the same time they are anticipating high losses if the situation is not controlled immediately.Giving more information, Ankit Sahni, a city-based importer, said, “After the reports of spread of corona virus in China, I have cancelled my visit to Guangzhou. Due to the last minute cancellation, I will have to bear losses on account of cancellation of my air ticket and forfeiture of my hotel booking. Besides this, it is going to cost me dear as I was going to China to finalise a deal of import of tyres and now, I will have to wait until the situation improves there.”According to Sanjeev Sharma, an auto parts importer, “Wuhan, which is said to be the epicentre of the corona virus, is one of the largest industrial hubs of China and there is a huge number of automotive component factories located there. The outbreak of the deadly virus has already started casting its shadow on business as since Monday, we are unable to contact one of our prominent suppliers, who is based in Wuhan. If the epidemic is not controlled, along with the mounting loss of lives, it will also lead to huge losses for both businessmen in China and those who trade with them.”According to Ravi Kant Chabra, another importer based in Ludhiana, “This corona virus problem is evident from the fact that how hard it is now to do international business. Spreading of such epidemics not only makes travelling and doing business in such countries impossible but at the same time it also has its side effects like temporary closure of trade or stringent checking of consignments, which in turn causes delays in shipments, eventually resulting in heavy losses for us.”
