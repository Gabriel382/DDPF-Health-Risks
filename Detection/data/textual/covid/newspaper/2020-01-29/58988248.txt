Young woman tested for coronavirus in Tas 
 A young woman is being tested for coronavirus in Tasmania but heath authorities say it is unlikely she has the deadly disease.
The woman, in her 20s, reported feeling unwell after a recent trip to China and is being tested at the Launceston General Hospital.
"While coronavirus is not strongly suspected, health authorities are taking a precautionary approach," Director of Public Health, Dr Mark Veitch, said on Wednesday.
She is the second person to be tested for coronavirus in the state after a Hobart man was at the weekend cleared of having the virus.
He had travelled earlier in January to Wuhan in China.
The state government, meanwhile, has announced support measures for Tasmania's rock lobster industry due to Chinese trade restrictions brought on by the virus.
Rock lobster quotas have been rolled over into next year, while annual fishery fees and levies can now be paid by instalment.
China accounts for about 80 per cent of Tasmania's rock lobster exports.
