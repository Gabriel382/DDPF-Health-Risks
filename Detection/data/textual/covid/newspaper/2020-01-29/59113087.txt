Finlandâ€™s first coronavirus case confirmed in Lapland 
 A Chinese tourist who was admitted to hospital for tests after showing symptoms was confirmed to have the deadly new strain of coronavirus that has so far killed more than a hundred people in China.

Markku Broas from Lapland Central Hospital said that the tourist left Wuhan province five days ago. The province, which is the epicentre of the current outbreak, was shut down soon afterwards by Chinese authorities trying to stop the spread of the disease.

The tourist is said to be a female aged 32 and in relatively good health. She sought medical attention in Ivalo when symptoms first appeared. Samples were taken after a transfer to Lapland Central Hospital in Rovaniemi. Tests conducted in Helsinki confirmed the infection.

Officials from the National Institute for Health and Welfare, THL were scheduled to host a press conference at 6pm on Wednesday.

The virus has spread to more than 16 countries so far, with more than 130 people dead and nearly 6,000 confirmed cases in China up to Wednesday afternoon.

Symptoms are very similar to ordinary colds and flu, and patients are advised to take extra precautions when these symptoms appear.

The virus can be spread before symptoms appear, and some cases are very mild, so it is likely people have unwittingly carried the virus.

Last Friday two other visitors were declared to be free of novel coronavirus infection after initially being suspected of carrying the disease.

In that case, a father and son had come to Lapland from Wuhan via Norway and sought treatment at a health centre. However tests conducted by THL confirmed that they were not infected by the Wuhan strain of coronavirus, but some other viral respiratory infection.
