Coronavirus a global health emergency? WHO chief calls meeting to assess situation 
 The head of the World Health Organization on Wednesday called a new emergency meeting of experts to discuss whether the coronavirus outbreak that began in China constitutes an international health emergency. "I have decided to reconvene the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) tomorrow," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter.

The WHO chief said that while he was not yet declaring a global health emergency due to coronavirus outbreak, the situation may change soon.

"Most of the 6000+ new coronavirus cases are in China just 1 per cent, or 68 cases, have been recorded to date in 15 other countries. But some person-to-person transmission in three countries outside of China has been recorded. This potential for further global spread is why I called the EC," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was in China on Wednesday to assess the level of coronavirus outbreak in the nation, said that the country has been doing a good job in controlling the disease.

He also said that the World Health Organisation was working round the clock with networks of scientists, clinicians, disease trackers, governments and others to coordinate the new coronavirus response.

The WHO chief said that the people who have contracted new coronavirus are showing a wide range of symptoms. Of known cases, most people exhibit milder symptoms, but about one in five people have a severe illness, including pneumonia and respiratory failure.

"People can take a range of measures to protect their health, including hand-washing and properly covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing," he said.
