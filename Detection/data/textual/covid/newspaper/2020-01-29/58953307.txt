How dangerous is new coronavirus and other questions answered 
 Scientists around the world are racing to understand the deadly coronavirus that
emerged in China last month. Several thousand people have already been infected,
with the number of cases rising rapidly because of the huge number of Chinese on
the move for the lunar new year holiday. International travellers have helped to
spread it further afield, including to the US and Europe. There are fears that,
if the respiratory illness that probably started in a food market in the central
city of Wuhan continues to spread, it will develop into a serious epidemic.

Worryingly, it seems to transmit more readily between humans than Sars, a
similar coronavirus that killed almost 800 people after it originated in China
17 years ago.

Computer modelling at Imperial College London and Lancaster University in the UK
suggest that each new coronavirus case is infecting on average about 2.5 other
people.

The new virus is, however, less virulent than Sars, which killed 10 per cent of
those infected. So far nCoV has caused severe respiratory disease in about a
quarter of the confirmed cases and killed 2-3 per cent of patients.

But experts warn that fatality rates are hard to estimate in the early stages of
an outbreak — and the virus may mutate as it passes between people. It is also
impossible to predict whether genetic changes will make it more or less
virulent.

For comparison, seasonal flu has a mortality rate well below 0.1 but it infects
so many people that around 400,000 deaths a year worldwide are attributable to
flu. New pandemic flu strains are far more dangerous: Spanish flu in 1918-19
infected 500m and killed 50m worldwide.

HOW DOES THE VIRUS SPREAD AND WHAT IS THE INCUBATION PERIOD? 
Coronavirus has now spread to 18 countries with 4529 confirmed cases and 106 deaths [https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd462125e-41f8-11ea-bdb5-169ba7be433d?fit=scale-down=next=700]
Coronavirus has now spread to 18 countries with 4529 confirmed cases and 106
deathsThere is still a wide range of estimates for the incubation period, from
two to 10 days according to the World Health Organization. The transmission
routes between people are still under investigation. An important question still
to be resolved is whether people who are infected can pass on the virus if they
are not showing symptoms.

The new nCoV virus is spreading faster than Sars, which affected 8,000 people
over eight months. The number of confirmed cases in the current outbreak has
risen to nearly 6,000 within a month — and there are almost 7,000 suspected
cases. Epidemiologists fear that nCoV has already infected tens of thousands
more people. 

CAN MASKS HELP PROTECT AGAINST INFECTION?

Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s leader, and other officials from the territory wore
protective masks when addressing the media at a press conference on Tuesday. Yet
there is considerable debate among public health experts about the preventive
effectiveness of covering the face to prevent infection.

Surgical grade masks will help but there is no consensus about whether flimsy
mass-produced versions are of any use. The WHO does not mention masks in its
advice to avoid infection.

“Wearing face masks may give a false sense of security,” said Bill Keevil,
professor of environmental healthcare at Southampton university, adding that
good hand hygiene was most important. Tests in his laboratory have shown that
coronavirus can survive for four days on common materials such as plastics,
glass and stainless steel.

HOW CAN DOCTORS TELL WHETHER A PATIENT HAS CORONAVIRUS AND ARE VACCINES BEING
DEVELOPED?

sequence of nCoV on January 10, laboratories anywhere in the world have been
able to test patient samples for its presence. This is done using a procedure
called real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to identify the virus’s
genetic code. But RT-PCR is slow and requires specialist equipment, so
researchers are rushing to develop faster, cheaper and more portable tests.

No existing drugs are designed to treat coronaviruses, though some antiviral
medicines may alleviate the symptoms. Chinese doctors are giving patients
combinations of HIV drugs, and another antiviral developed to treat Ebola has
shown promise against coronavirus in animal tests. Clinical experience in China
will show whether any of these help against nCoV.

A crash programme to develop a vaccine to prevent nCoV infection is also under
way under the auspices of the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations (Cepi) — a $750m partnership set up in 2017 by governments, industry
and charities to prevent future pandemics.

Cepi has launched three projects using different technologies to prepare nCoV
vaccine candidates. Richard Hatchett, chief executive, said the aim was to have
one ready for preliminary testing on human volunteers within 16 weeks. But even
if the programme goes well, no vaccine is likely to be ready for mass
administration in less than a year. 

IS THE WHO RIGHT NOT TO HAVE DECLARED AN INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY?

Regulations emergency committee for pneumonia due to the Novel Coronavirus
2019-nCoV in Geneva, Switzerland © Christopher Black/WHO/ReutersAt a two-day
meeting last week, the WHO emergency committee voted by a very narrow margin not
to declare a so-called public health emergency of international concern. Such a
measure has been announced five times over the past decade, including over last
year’s Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The WHO justified its decision to hold fire on the grounds that the disease had
not spread beyond China sufficiently to justify a global emergency. Yet many
international health experts have called that decision a mistake, saying that
they expect the WHO to change its mind very soon if the outbreak continues to
spread at its current rate.

Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,
said: “The fact that there are cases now in so many countries and that it is
spreading fast is of international concern. I do not know what more they need.”

Declaring a public health emergency would not make a huge difference in
practice, given the scale of international action already taking place, but it
would be an important symbolic statement. The WHO said it was “on standby to
reconvene the emergency committee at very short notice”.
