352 Sandy Bay Rd, Sandy Bay: Million-dollar makeover 
 IT sits among that slim strip of waterfront houses between the Royal Yacht Club of Tasmania and Wrest Point Casino, but it’s as quiet as a library thanks for an impressive seven-figure renovation that includes top-of-the-range glazing.
Other features of the four-level executive residence include three bespoke kitchens, a comprehensive security system, an outdoor kitchen and one of the city’s few concrete jetties.
There’s also a waterside bedsit apartment.
Entry is through the secure tall front gates and on to an impressive foyer.
St Andrews Estate Agents director Steve Yannarakis said the immaculate residence had been comprehensively refurbished to exacting standards with properties of its calibre seldom on offer.
352 Sandy Bay Rd, Sandy Bay is open for expressions of interest.
