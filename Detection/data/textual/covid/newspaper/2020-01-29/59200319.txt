Searches for beer surge due to deadly virus outbreak 
 The coronavirus outbreak appears to have led to people fearing their favourite beer is linked to the deadly bug. 
In the mistaken belief that the famous Mexican brand Corona may somehow be connected to the virus, searches such as “corona beer virus” have been surging.
The beer is famously drunk with a lime in the neck but it’s not connected to the virus in any way.
The virus first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan. So far 132 people have been killed and more than 6,000 infected.

According to data from Google trends, “beer coronavirus” searches have increased substantially around the world since January 18.
Cambodia and Denmark topped the list of places which saw a surge in searches for the term.
Global searches of “corona beer virus” between January 18 and January 26 jumped 2,300 per cent.
In the same period, “beer virus” searches jumped 744 per cent and for “beer coronavirus”, 3,233 per cent.
In Spanish, “corona” means crowns, and Corona beer originated in Mexico. But in English, the anatomical term “corona” is used for body parts resembling a crown.
A recent prank video showed a woman wearing a medical face mask and gloves, opening the Mexican beers and yelling “I’m getting rid of the virus”.
The coronavirus is named because its external cell structure has little crown-like spikes.
Fears have been raised over a rise in coronavirus patients who’ve never been to China.
So far there have been 97 people tested in the UK for the virus, and dramatic video showed the moment hazmat-wearing paramedics quarantined a suspected patient in Birmingham.
Up to 200 people from Britain are expected to be flown back from Wuhan, the centre of the deadly outbreak, in the coming days.
