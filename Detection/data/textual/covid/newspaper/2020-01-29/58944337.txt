Logs 1st gain in four sessions 
 Mumbai: The rupee clocked its first gain after three days of losses on Tuesday, recovering by 12 paise to close at 71.31 against the $, even as concerns remained over fast-spreading coronavirus from China to other regions. 
The domestic unit's rise was restricted by a host of factors like subdued equities, stronger dollar against key currencies and sustained foreign fund outflows, according to analysts. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 71.37. During the day, the local unit saw a high of 71.26 and a low of 71.41. 
The domestic unit finally settled at 71.31, up 12 paise from its previous close. The rupee had settled at 71.43 against the American currency on Monday.
