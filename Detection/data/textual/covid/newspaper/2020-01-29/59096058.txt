Royal Caribbean says China travel restrictions will likely shave 10 cents off 2020 per-share earnings 
 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, +1.28% said Wednesday that the travel restrictions that have led it to cancel three sailings to China through Feb. 8 will likely shave 10 cents off its 2020 per-share earnings. If the current restrictions, put in place to contain the outbreak of a coronavirus, were to continue to the end of February, it would likely shave another 10 cents off the 2020 figure. "There are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding this outbreak to calculate the overall impact on the business," the company said in a statement. "For example, we expect an erosion of consumer confidence in China could have an additional impact on load factor and rate in the region until the market normalizes." If the restrictions were to continue for a longer period, "they could have a material impact on the overall financial performance of the company," the statement said. Royal Caribbean has just one ship based in China for the winter sailing season, but two additional ships are slated to join in May and July. China represents about 6% of the company's overall 2020 capacity. The company is expecting to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 4 and will discuss its 2020 outlook then. Shares rose 0.9% in early trade Wednesday, but are down 9% in the month to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.44% has gained 1.5%.
