Will wearing water jugs on your head combat coronavirus? 
 As if wearing face masks, washing your hands and using sanitizer wasn’t enough.

It’s no secret people are a little paranoid since the coronavirus spread worldwide from Wuhan, China. Knowing this, some people will go to great lengths to protect themselves from catching the illness.

Apparently, this now includes wearing plastic water jugs on your head. Yup, you read that right.

In pictures posted on Facebook on Jan. 28 by Lynn Carter, a woman can be seen at Vancouver International Airport wearing what appears to be a plastic water bottle on her head while also donning a surgical mask over her mouth.

The lid of the bottle is missing in order to let the person breathe. A hole was also cut into the back of the bottle to feed her ponytail through.

According to online publication Vancouver Is Awesome, a third photo was also posted by Carter depicting another woman with a child, both wearing bottles on their heads, while riding a train.

There has been one confirmed case of the coronavirus in B.C. after a man in his 40s arrived home to Vancouver last week after travelling to Wuhan.

There are two confirmed cases of the virus in Ontario after a man and his wife – both in their 50s – were the first Canadians diagnosed with the novel virus.

There are more currently more than 5,900 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in China, of which 132 have died.

In order to protect yourself against the coronavirus, Health Canada recommends people wash their hands often, avoid contact with sick people and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t recommend wearing plastic bottles on your head to prevent coronavirus infection.
