Ohio health officials investigating 2 possible cases of coronavirus 
 OXFORD, Ohio â€” There are two possible cases of the coronavirus under investigation, according to the Ohio Department of Health.
Two students at Miami University in southern Ohio were tested for the virus. The CDC hopes to have results back by end of week.
According to health officials in Butler County, both people who were tested recently traveled and returned from China. Both possible cases are not severely ill and currently in isolation to keep the illness from spreading.
      
    
        
    
The immediate health risk to the Miami University campus community is low, according to the Butler County General Health District. Officials gave an update on the situation earlier today:

    

"We don't want fear,"Dr. Amy Acton, Director of the Ohio Department of Health, said. "We are much more likely to see a disease of contagion of fear, than the actual disease."
While administrators are urging those on and around campus not to panic, the school did postpone its men's and women's basketball games scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday night, respectively.
"Right now, there is no spread of this virus in our communities here at home" CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, MD, said. "This is why our current assessment is that the immediate health risk of this new virus to the general public is low in our nation."
3News' Monica Robins joined Betsy Kling and Jay Crawford Tuesday on What's New to discuss the spread of the virus:
