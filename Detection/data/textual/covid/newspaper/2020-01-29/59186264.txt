Australian shares set to open slightly lower on virus fears 
 Jan 30 (Reuters) - Australian shares are expected to open
slightly lower on Thursday due to fears over the fast-spreading
coronavirus. 
    The local share price index futures          fell 0.1%, a
77.5-point discount to the underlying SP/ASX 200 index        
close. The benchmark rose 0.5% on Wednesday.
    New Zealand's benchmark SP/NZX 50 index         was little
changed in early trade.
