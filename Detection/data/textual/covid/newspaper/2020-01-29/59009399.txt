Cebu City mayor wants Chinese tourists barred amid nCoV scare 
 CEBU CITY—Mayor Edgardo Labella said he would ask the Bureau of Immigration (BI) to ban the entry of Chinese tourists in Cebu to prevent infections from the deadly novel coronavirus (nCoV) in the city.

In a statement, Labella said nCoV should be everyone’s concern.

“Who should not be concerned? We should all be concerned,” the mayor said.

“And while we are concerned, we have to do something. We have to take steps to prevent this disease from affecting our people in the city of Cebu,” said Labella.

On Friday, Jan. 31, Labella will meet with officials of the Bureau of Quarantine, Department of Health (DOH), the BI, and chiefs of public and private hospitals in the city to plot measures to prevent the entry of the deadly virus in the city, one of the country’s premiere tourist destinations.
