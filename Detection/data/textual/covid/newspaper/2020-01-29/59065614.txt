MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 29th January, 2020) British Airways said on Wednesday that it had halted all but essential flights to and from China, to ensure the safety of its passengers and crew members amid the new coronavirus outbreak.
"We have suspended all flights to and from mainland China with immediate effect following advice from the Foreign Office against all but essential travel," the company said in a press release, as quoted by UK media.
Ticket booking services through the airline's website will be unavailable for the given routes until March 1.
