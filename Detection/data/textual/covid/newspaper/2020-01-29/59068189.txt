Coronavirus Patients In China Are Allegedly 'Spitting' On People & Deliberately Spreading Virus 
 Apart from the deadly virus claiming more than 100 lives, more disturbing reports are emerging about the way people are dealing with the outbreak in China. Reports state that some people are deliberately trying to infect people with the virus by spitting on them.

Disturbing footage recorded at a hospital's CCTV shows infected patients coughing and licking objects kept on a reception table. 
  Speaking to Metro UK, Jessika Bailing, 23 who works as a teacher in Wuhan said, "We are all so scared to go outside, I avoided it for as long as I could. I went to do a supply run, it was so terrifying. I covered myself from head-to-toe with gloves on my hands, glasses to cover my eyes and of course, my mask."
She added, "I’ve heard shocking stories about infected people going out of their way to contaminate others by taking off their masks and spitting in doctors’ faces."
 "We’ve been told the virus can stay on objects for some time, so I made sure to wash all of the items I bought from the store, including packets of crisps, bottles of water, chocolate bars and even coffee sachets," she said. 

Apart from the alleged news of people infecting each other, another horrific though unverified video leaked from a hospital in Wuhan, shows dead bodies lying in a corridor unattended, with sick people on the side. 
According to the Daily Mail, the woman who filmed the video claims authorities are concealing the true scale of the outbreak, keeping casualty figures artificially low. 

   According to Reuters, there are now 4,515 people across China infected by the SARS-like illness. Germany has recorded its first case of coronavirus as the lethal infection hits Europe while one person in Beijing has died from the illness bringing the total number of those killed to 106.
