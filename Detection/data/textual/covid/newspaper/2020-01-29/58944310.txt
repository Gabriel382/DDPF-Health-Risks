Australians in Wuhan to be evacuated, quarantined on Christmas Island 
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the government is preparing to evacuate Australians currently in Wuhan where the deadly coronavirus is believed to have originated. Mr Morrison said the operation - to be carried out in cooperation with the New Zealand government - would target "isolated and vulnerable" Australians. The prime minister said the government was establishing a quarantine zone on Christmas Island in preparation for the evacuees. He said they would remain on the island, where they would undergo testing, for an estimated 14 days.
