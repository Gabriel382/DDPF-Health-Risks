China Coronavirus outbreak: How many people have REALLY been infected? Latest death toll 
 Speaking to the BBC, disease outbreak scientist Professor Neil Ferguson said: “I am substantially more concerned than I was a week ago.
“For Wuhan to have exported three cases to other countries would imply there would have to be many more cases than have been reported.”
The 1,700 figure was calculated by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, which advises bodies including the UK government and the World Health Organization (WHO).
The organisation cannot calcualte the exact number, but it used outbreak modelling, which is based on the virus, the local population and flight data.
