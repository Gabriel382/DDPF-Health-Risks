CDC to Screen for Deadly New Chinese Virus at Three US Airports 
 Passengers travelling to the United States from the Chinese city of Wuhan will undergo health screenings for the new coronavirus, following the outbreak, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a press release on Friday.

The health agency said that the new procedures will be implemented on all passengers arriving at the airports of San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX), which receives the highest number of travelers from Wuhan.

CDC will also deploy 100 additional staff members, in addition to those already employed at the three airports, to work at the facilities' quarantine stations. The agency said that it may adjust screening procedures and other response activities as additional information is gathered about the new virus.

At the end of December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, a city in the central Chinese province of Hubei, reported that 27 people had been infected with a pneumonia of an unknown kind during that month. On 3 January, local authorities confirmed that the number of infected people had reached 44.

Two infection cases of the coronavirus were registered, one in Thailand and one in Japan, and both of the infected were reported to have come from Wuhan.

On 11 January, the first case of death at the hands of pneumonia caused by the mysterious new coronavirus was reported, and another death was reported Friday.
