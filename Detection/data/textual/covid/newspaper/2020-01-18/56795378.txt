Mystery deadly virus that causes lung lesions has ‘infected hundreds’ and sweeping China and Japan 
 Hundreds of people have been infected by a mystery virus sweeping China and Japan, scientists warned today.



The SARS-like virus that causes lung lesions has already killed two people and is spreading across Asia.



Although there have been 45 confirmed cases, scientists fear up to 1,700 have been infected.



Of the confirmed cases, two people are known to have died due to pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus, which appeared in Wuhan city in December.



Five others have been reported to be in critical condition and 22 are in a stable condition, said the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.



But a report published by the London Imperial College’s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis claimed there are likely “substantially more cases” of the new coronavirus than have been formally reported.
