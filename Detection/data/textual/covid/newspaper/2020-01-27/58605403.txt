Good Monday morning. Brexit Day is four days away. And so is the deadline for your tax return.

DRIVING THE DAY

HUAWEI, AND UP SHE RISES: Boris Johnson is preparing to make two massive decisions about Britain’s long-term infrastructure as the nation gears up for a momentous week. The prime minister will chair a hotly-anticipated meeting of the National Security Council tomorrow, where ministers and officials will debate whether to defy U.S. pressure and allow Chinese tech giant Huawei to help build the 5G comms network upon which all of our lives will depend in the years ahead.

Johnson will also meet with senior colleagues this week to decide whether to proceed with the £100 billion(ish) construction of a new high-speed railway that will form the backbone of Britain’s north-south transport network for decades to come. These are seismic days for the future of the nation … and then we leave the EU on Friday night.

Yanks for nothing: Johnson is facing a flurry of last-minute lobbying from Washington — and from his own backbenches — amid widespread reports that he is ready to grant Huawei limited access to the U.K.’s 5G network. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last night tweeted in support of a Mail on Sunday op-ed by Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, who urged the PM to think again. “The U.K. has a momentous decision ahead on 5G,” Pompeo said. “British MP Tom Tugendhat gets it right: ‘The truth is that only nations able to protect their data will be sovereign.’”

Coming attractions: Pompeo flies into London on Wednesday for face-to-face talks, and you can be certain Huawei will be at the very top of his in tray — even if (as Larisa Brown reports in the Mail) Washington is under no illusion about Johnson’s current plans. The Daily Telegraph splashes on Pompeo’s tweet this morning and suggests Donald Trump himself will make a personal intervention in the coming days. So it’s all eyes on the president’s Twitter feed over the next 48 hours.

And there’s more: On the eve of Pompeo’s visit, a senior Trump administration official seeks to pile further pressure on Downing Street via an interview with U.S. media outlet Axios. “This is a highly consequential decision that the British prime minister’s going to be making,” the unnamed official said. “Not only in terms of their relationship with the United States, but first and foremost for their own citizens. People are going to be a bit shaken by the U.K.’s judgment if they make this decision.”

Tory unease: Plenty of senior Tories are also deeply unhappy about Huawei’s likely involvement, as was made clear in reams of column inches over the weekend. Tugendhat — the former Commons foreign affairs committee chairman — was still tweeting his concerns at 1.08 a.m. this morning, which is definitely not a healthy way to start the week. And Theresa May’s former chief of staff Nick Timothy also sounds the alarm today via his weekly Telegraph column. “Allowing this Chinese fox into the hen house would be a generation-defining error,” Timothy writes, “exposing British companies to the theft of intellectual property, British governments to geopolitical blackmail, and the British people to economic and security danger.”

Am I bovvered? But despite the intense pressure, Johnson seems poised to allow Huawei to build at least parts of the new hi-tech network. The weekend papers were heavily briefed that the PM is unmoved by Washington’s warnings/pleading/bullying and will press ahead regardless, citing high-level assessments by British security services that granting limited access to Huawei is not a serious risk. Indeed the Times today reports Downing Street has been “irritated” by the U.S. approach and has repeatedly asked Washington to suggest an alternative source for the technology — but to no avail.

Not for turning: Justice Secretary Robert Buckland was on BBC Radio 4’s The Westminster Hour last night and struck a defiant tone. “The decision we make will be based upon our own sovereign right to choose,” he said. “It’s Britain that will have to live with the consequences of that. There are risks but we will make an informed decision based on the evidence, and we will do so in an autonomous way.”

Calm down: Former national security adviser Peter Ricketts told the same Radio 4 show that the risk from Huawei “is being blown out of proportion.” He added: “I’m quite sure, knowing the intelligence community well, that they won’t be recommending to ministers the course of action that is likely to mess up our intelligence relationship with the U.S. or prejudice U.K. security. I personally think we can find a solution which does allow them [Huawei] to have some role and which doesn’t send the Americans off the other side of the diving board.”

Third way? The FT splash agrees that Johnson will approve Huawei’s involvement tomorrow, albeit with further restrictions on the Chinese firm. “The U.K. prime minister is now looking at imposing a market share cap on Huawei, according to people close to the discussions, in an attempt to bring other suppliers in and to avoid over-reliance on the Chinese company,” George Parker and Nic Fildes report. The compromise proposal “would add cost for the industry rolling out 5G, but would be less of a setback than a total ban on using Huawei,” they write.

Train-ing day: Once Huawei’s out the way, Johnson must decide whether to press ahead with the new HS2 rail line, which with an estimated £80 billion-£100 billion price tag is Europe’s biggest infrastructure project. The PM will meet Chancellor Sajid Javid and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to hammer out a final decision this week (h/t the Sunday Times), and as with Huawei, it looks rather like — after much prevarication — he will ultimately stick with the decision he inherited from Theresa May. Plenty of papers pick up on Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay’s comment on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that his “gut instinct” tells him the project will go ahead, and his Cabinet colleague Buckland did little to dispel that notion on Radio 4 last night. “It might be that like the Victorians, taking the plunge and building these major infrastructure projects is the right thing to do, even though at the time … it is deeply controversial,” Buckland said.

ICYMI on Saturday — Big news from Downing Street: The PM’s press secretary Rob Oxley is headed to the Foreign Office to become Dominic Raab’s media SpAd in a new souped-up department incorporating the international development department, James Forsyth revealed in the Sun. Oxley has long been a key figure in the Vote Leave axis now running the government, though he’s perhaps best known for swearing like a trooper on Good Morning Britain while his boss hid in a large fridge. He will be replaced in No. 10 by the Daily Mail’s associate editor Jack Doyle, a highly experienced political journalist currently based in the lobby. BuzzFeed’s Alex Wickham got the scoop on that appointment.

Spot a theme here? As the PM’s new political press secretary, Doyle will be working alongside Johnson’s civil service spokesman James Slack, a former colleague from the Daily Mail. That means the PM’s two main spokesmen are also the two men who between them spent most of the 2010s writing Paul Dacre’s leader columns in the Mail — literally the editor’s voice in the paper. Which gives you some indication of where this government is at.

MEANWHILE IN BREXIT

BARNIER IN IRELAND: The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is in Ireland today and will meet with Irish PM Leo Varadkar in Dublin this morning. The two men will discuss the prospect of a post-Brexit trade deal, with Varadkar telling the Irish edition of the Sunday Times that Johnson has personally assured him Britain does not intend to undercut EU standards.

“What Boris Johnson says to me when I meet him is that he and the British government are a little bit offended by this idea that the U.K. is going to go down that route,” Varadkar said. “He says to me, ‘There’s absolutely no way I’d get chlorinated chicken through the House of Commons. Even if I wanted to, I wouldn’t get it through my own public.'” Keep an eye out for press statements from Varadkar and Barnier following the 9 a.m. meeting.

North of the border: Barnier then travels on to Northern Ireland, where he will meet with Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill (of Sinn Féin) and Economy Minister Diane Dodds (of the DUP) for further talks this afternoon. O’Neill “will make it clear today that a majority of voters in the north voted to remain, and will be asking for assurances around Irish rights, peace and the economy,” the Irish News reports.

And finally: Barnier is due to give a lecture titled “Reflections on Brexit and the European Union” at Queen’s University Belfast at 5.30 p.m.

What Barnier is worrying about: The FT reports that one of Brussels’ chief concerns is that Britain will gain an unfair advantage over EU27 competitors after Brexit by intervening more quickly to support struggling businesses than EU rules allow. “State aid is going to be a critical area in the negotiations,” one senior EU diplomat tells the paper. “We will need to see some form of dynamic alignment in this area.” Given his opposition to the “high alignment” model proposed by his predecessor, it’s hard to imagine Johnson agreeing to that.

Dom’s talent show: Downing Street’s big Brexit announcement today is the launch of new so-called global talent visas to attract scientists, researchers and mathematicians to the country. They will replace existing tier 1 (exceptional talent) visas, which are currently offered to up to 2,000 highly-skilled artists and scientists from outside the EEA each year. (The Guardian’s Rowena Mason notes the cap has never actually been reached.) The new visas will have no cap on numbers at all, and the range of official bodies that can sponsor an applicant has been extended in an effort to increase immigration among scientists and researchers. At the same time, an extra £60 million a year is being made available to boost maths research. The whole announcement has a distinctly Cummingsonian ring to it, as the Times splash notes.

Brex-enomics: Economists Gerard Lyons, Vicky Pryce and John Van Reenen will be debating the implications of Brexit for the U.K. economy at an event at the LSE this evening.

Party night: Plenty of chatter over the weekend around how politicians on all sides of the Brexit debate will be marking the moment Britain leaves the EU on Friday night. The Sunday Express’ David Williamson reported the prime minister — after addressing the nation on TV at 10 p.m. — will be “hosting a gathering of colleagues and friends inside Downing Street.”

Just down the road, Tory MPs Mark Francois, Andrew Bridgen and other ERG colleagues will be attending Nigel Farage’s victory party on Parliament Square, which Remainer MPs have already dubbed “GloatFest.” Farage told the Mail on Sunday a band has been hired to play “God Save the Queen” at 11 p.m., and Francois clearly cannot wait. “I’m not going to bed,” he told the paper excitedly. “I’m going to stay and watch the sun rise on a free country.” Let’s hope they’re serving vodka Red Bulls — sunrise on Saturday is not until 7.40 a.m. And yes, it is due to rain.

Meanwhile in Essex: Fellow Tory Brexiteer Andrew Rosindell told the Sunday Express he’s having a big party at Romford Conservative Association. “We’ve got music from around the British Isles, and singing and dancing from all parts of the U.K.,” he said. “We’ve got a great British buffet, with food from around the U.K. and English sparkling wine — nothing French or German.”

Planet Remainiac: On the Westminster Hour last night, former Chancellor Ken Clarke said he would spend Friday evening in reflection. “I will reflect on it. I am still very disappointed,” he said. “I did hear talk of bells ringing. If anybody actually manages to ring any, I hope it will be a slow, mournful toll.”

“The emotion will be between deep sadness and real anger for a lot of people,” former FCO chief Peter Ricketts added. “You ask what [I] will do on Friday night. I will give a hint to listeners. Churchill said of a glass of Champagne — ‘In victory, I deserve it. In defeat, I need it.'”

LABOUR LAND

STARMER RETURNS: Labour leadership hopeful Keir Starmer returns to the campaign trail today after a family crisis forced him to step back from politics over the weekend. The shadow Brexit secretary has a big morning broadcast round lined up including the 7.50 a.m interview on the Today program. Starmer remains the frontrunner in the contest, having scooped up 59 percent of the CLP nominations so far (though the vast majority have yet to declare). In a speech in east London this evening, Starmer will back the creation of a fully federal U.K. to “repair the shattered trust in politics,” with power devolved to the nations and regions of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after Brexit. The Guardian has the story. Tomorrow Starmer will embark on a three-day tour of Great Britain.

Two can play at that game: Starmer’s speech follows a similar proclamation from his rival Rebecca Long-Bailey at yesterday’s leadership hustings, where she called for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments to be put on an “equal footing.”

Jezza backs Becky … kind of: The Times’ Francis Elliott reports Jeremy Corbyn — who is definitely not endorsing any particular candidate, nope, no siree Bob — showered praise on RLB at an event on Saturday night. Speaking at a retirement dinner for former Blyth Valley MP Ronnie Campbell, Corbyn said: “It’s an absolute pleasure to be here alongside Becky Long-Bailey, our candidate for leader. I’ve known Becky since we came into parliament and we’ve worked very well together. She has done the most to develop our trade union policies.” He then added that Long-Bailey had been “steadfast” when others — such as, ooh, let’s say Starmer and Lisa Nandy — had deserted him in the failed ‘coup’ of 2016. Corbyn’s office insists he was “speaking in an inclusive way, rather than intending to endorse anyone.” So now you know.

Definitely endorsing someone: Some members of Corbyn’s team, who are privately hoping they may bag jobs with Long-Bailey if she wins.

Still struggling for endorsements: Emily Thornberry, who remains mired on just three CLP nominations — way short of the 33 she needs to make the final ballot. She has 18 days to go, and there are hundreds of CLPs yet to nominate, but it definitely doesn’t bode well.

Return of the Mack: Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell makes his first big public speech this evening, at an event in Portcullis House on nationalization.

TODAY IN WESTMINSTER

PARLIAMENT: Commons sits from 2.30 p.m. with an hour of work and pensions questions.

HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY: Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will be among the speakers at the Holocaust Memorial Day event in London today, marking the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the camps. The government is announcing a £1 million donation to the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum to help maintain the foundation’s work.

Speaking of Raab: He will be meeting this afternoon with the family of Harry Dunn, the teenage motorcyclist killed in a hit-and-run last year. Dunn’s parents want Raab to take a hard line with Pompeo when he arrives in the U.K. later this week. The U.S. is resisting efforts to extradite the hit-and-run suspect in the case. The Evening Standard has a preview.

CORONA WATCH: The number of people killed in China by the coronavirus has risen to 80, the BBC reports this morning, with almost 3,000 confirmed ill. We’re still waiting for the first case here in the U.K., but with cases already confirmed in the United States and Australia, you’d have to assume it’s only a matter of time. In the meantime, questions are mounting about how the FCO intends to evacuate British citizens trapped in quarantined Chinese cities. Don’t be surprised if we get another urgent question or ministerial statement in the Commons this afternoon.

ELECTION DEADLINE: The race to chair select committees is reaching its conclusion, with nominations for candidates closing at 4 p.m. today. MPs will be balloted on Wednesday, with the results announced later that afternoon.

BUDGET WATCH: Javid plans to scale back a £2.4 billion-a-year tax break for entrepreneurs who sell their businesses when he unveils his first budget in March, the FT’s Jim Pickard reports. Experts believe the cash will be retargeted at entrepreneurs starting up firms instead.

SHOULD KEN CLARKE GET A PEERAGE? Yes, said Tory Cabinet Minister Buckland on the radio last night. “I will stick my neck out and I will say it’s a no-brainer for me.”

NOT SO SMART: The government is reconsidering how so-called smart motorways are deployed amid rising concern about accidents and near misses, BBC Panorama will report tonight. A Freedom of Information request sent by Panorama to Highways England revealed that on one section of the M25, the number of near misses had risen 20-fold since the motorway’s hard shoulder was removed in April 2014. The show is on BBC1 at 8.30 p.m. BBC online story here.

TODAY PROGRAM ON TOUR: The Today program is not, in fact, going to be spending half its week in Manchester, the Times reports today, despite excitable reports in the Sunday papers. However, the program will be going on tour — dare I say, a la Playbook — “to shine a light on the government’s performance outside the capital.”

BEYOND THE M25

From Northern Ireland

From southern Ireland

TWELVE DAYS TO GO: The seven main party leaders will take part in an RTE election debate in Galway tonight, ahead of the Irish general election next weekend. Twitter is today launching a special Irish election emoji, triggered by the English and Irish language hashtags #GE2020 and #Togh2020.

From D.C.

BOLTON MAKES HIS MOVE: Big news in Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, as his former aide and ally John Bolton reveals in a new book that the U.S. president told him critical military aid to Ukraine would remain suspended until the country’s government helped with an investigation targeting former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump has repeatedly insisted there was “no quid pro quo” offered to Ukraine. The New York Times got the scoop on the early draft of Bolton’s book, which has not yet been released. As my POLITICO colleague Andrew Desiderio reports, the revelation will fuel calls for Senate Republicans to allow witnesses — such as Bolton — to be called in the ongoing trial. Trump has already tweeted a furious denial.

LONDON CALLING

Westminster weather: 🌦🌦🌦 Light showers and spells of sunshine through the day, with highs of 9C.

Travel: London Overground reports no service between Barking and South Tottenham. Minor delays between Gospel Oak and South Tottenham. Check ahead.

Coming attractions: Get excited! Opening later this week just off Horseferry Road is Jacu, a much-hyped SW1 cafe offering the most expensive cup of coffee in Britain (h/t the Sunday Times). Yours for just £30 a cup will be a “super-premium” brew made from the excrement of the rare South American Jacu bird. Yes, really. The owner says he is “addicted” to the stuff and drinks a cup every five hours, which sounds like a pretty expensive habit. “This is the kind of taste you cannot experience anywhere in the U.K.,” he beams.

But but but: Before we all start feeling good about the thought of handing over hundreds of pounds a week for steaming mugs of bird poo, Playbook notes this £9-an-hour job advert would seem to suggest Jacu will not even be offering the London living wage to its own kitchen staff. Which means they will have to work for more than three hours in the kitchen to afford even a single cup. Nice.

Happy birthday: Government whip Maggie Throup … Sittingbourne and Sheppey MP Gordon Henderson … Former Health Secretary Alan Milburn … Tory peer and former Health Minister Julia Cumberlege … Tory peer and former MEP Patricia Rawlings … Tory peer Nigel Vinson … Former U.K. Ambassador to Iraq and Libya Frank Baker … Former U.K. Ambassador to China Christopher Hum.
