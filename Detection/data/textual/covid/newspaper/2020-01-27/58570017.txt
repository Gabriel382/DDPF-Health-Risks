Copper, base metals extend losses on China virus fears 
 Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) pre-market as copper prices tumble to their weakest levels in nearly eight weeks on demand worries due to the spreading Chinese coronavirus.

London benchmark three-month copper recently at $5,817/metric ton, its lowest since Dec. 4, after falling 5.5% last week.

"Chinese demand accounts for about 50% of the majority of base metals and looking at the latest data regarding the coronavirus, it's now spread quite widely," said analyst Timothy Wood-Dow at BMO Capital in London. "On Friday, we didn't know this, and it seemed quite contained."

Prices for nickel, lead, aluminum, zinc and tin are all lower.
