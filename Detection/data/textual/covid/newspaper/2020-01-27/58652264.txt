Impeach The Coronavirus — ‘Next! Week! This! Morning!’ Episode One 
 Welcome, Daily Ballers, to the premiere episode of our new weekly show, Next! Week! This! Morning!, the only show that breaks news BEFORE it happens.
 Each week, host Christian Datoc will run down the biggest upcoming events in worlds of politics, sports, movies, television, pop culture, and internet. It’s basically The Colbert Report, before he sold out. Or Last Week Tonight, but way less British. (RELATED: Maybe It’s Not The Bat Soup: Could Coronavirus Have Started As A Bioweapon?)
