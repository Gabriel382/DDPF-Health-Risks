Travel retailer Dufry says no big impact from coronavirus yet 
 ZURICH, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Swiss travel retailer Dufry said it had not yet seen any significant impact on its business from China's fast-spreading coronavirus that weighed on European and Swiss stocks on Monday.

Shares in Dufry, which has more than 400 stores in airports in 65 countries, were down 3.8% at 1515 GMT, lagging a 1.6% lower Swiss market.

"We have not seen any significant impact yet," a Dufry spokesman said in an emailed statement.

"We do expect some temporary impacts locally in airports where we have Chinese customers, but we cannot quantify these right now," he said, adding Chinese travellers represented about 8% of the group's sales. (Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz; editing by David Evans)
