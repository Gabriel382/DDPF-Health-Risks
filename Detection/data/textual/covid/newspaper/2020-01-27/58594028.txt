Trump offers to send medical experts to China to combat coronavirus 
 President Trump on Monday said his administration has been in contact with China and has offered US expertise to help the country combat the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

“We are in very close communication with China concerning the virus. Very few cases reported in USA, but strongly on watch. We have offered China and President Xi any help that is necessary,” the president tweeted. “Our experts are extraordinary!”

The virus, which broke out in the city of Wuhan, has killed at least 81 people in China and infected nearly 3,000 others.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said five cases of the deadly virus have been confirmed in the US but no deaths have been reported.

Another 60 people in the US have tested positive for the disease.
