Stock market live updates: Dow futures drop 400, coronavirus fears hit Wynn, Disney, Nike & Apple 
 Bank of America downgraded shares of hotel and casino chain Wynn Resorts to neutral from buy and lowered its price target to $150 per share from $160 per share as the Chinese coronavirus continues to spread, threatening travel and tourism-related stocks (see below). The deadly virus, which has killed more than 80 people and infected over 2,800 people, is getting stronger, forcing China to restricted travel for at least 35 million people across 15 cities. "Understandably, the Macau focused gaming names have traded off more than the broader market as they are 1) highly exposed to domestic Chinese travel, 2) the timing is concurrent with Chinese New Year," Bank of America equity analyst Shaun Kelley said in a note to clients Monday. After falling more than 11% last week, Wynn shares dropped once again on Monday. –Fitzgerald

Travel and gaming stocks are leading the broader market lower as fears over the coronavirus escalate. Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts, which have big China gaming operations, all dropped at least 4.5% in the premarket. Airline shares such as American, Delta and United each slid at least 3% on fears of a slowdown in global travel because of virus fears. Expedia was off by 4% and Marriott International by 3%. Estee Lauder and Nike, two consumer stocks with high China sales exposure, fell 4.1% and 2.5%, respectively. Disney and Apple both dipped more than 2%. —Imbert

U.S. stock futures are following global markets lower on Monday amid rising fears of the spreading coronavirus and its potential impact on the global economy. Around 7:50 a.m. ET, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures indicated a drop of more than 400 points at the open. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures pointed to a loss of more than 1% each. Fears spread after the death toll in China from the virus rose to 81 over the weekend, with more than 2,800 cases confirmed. —Imbert
