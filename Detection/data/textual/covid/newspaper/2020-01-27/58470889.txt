 Australia Confirms Fifth Case of Coronavirus in 21-Year-Old Woman

Health authorities in the Australian state of New South Wales have confirmed a 21-year-old woman has tested positive to coronavirus—making her the fifth person being treated in Australia.

A woman who was on the last flight out of Wuhan to arrive in Sydney has tested positive to coronavirus, taking to five the number of people being treated in Australia for the potentially deadly illness.

NSW Health on Monday afternoon confirmed a 21-year-old woman who arrived into Sydney Airport on Thursday subsequently developed symptoms and tested positive.

Chief health officer Dr. Kerry Chant said the woman was met at the airport by health officials and given advice on what to do if she became unwell—and she had followed that guidance.

The woman had been taken to Westmead Hospital, Dr. Chant told reporters.

Three men—aged 35, 43 and 53—are also being treated in hospital for coronavirus and are listed as stable.

In Victoria, a man in his 50s is being treated at Monash Medical Centre while four of his family members are being quarantined at home.
