Four possible coronavirus cases in WA 
 Four adults in Western Australia are being tested to see if they have contracted the deadly coronavirus.

The WA Department of Health would not confirm any further details about the patients on Monday but said they each met specific travel criteria.

There have been no confirmed cases in WA, with three people returning negative test results.

Chief health officer Andrew Robertson said the risk to the WA community remained low.

"We are continuing to monitor the situation very carefully and there is no need for alarm," Dr Robertson said.

"The Western Australian health system is very well prepared to manage infectious disease situations and have well-established systems and processes in place to protect the health of our community."

Any confirmed case of coronavirus would be reported to the federal government, he said.

The health department has issued updated advice to hospitals and GPs to help them identify and control any possible cases.

WA's crayfishing industry has meanwhile taken a hit as a result of the coronavirus outbreak in China, which accounts for more than half of the state's exports.

Michael Thompson, co-owner of Cervantes-based Lobster Shack, said the industry had been forced to halt deliveries after Lunar New Year celebrations were cancelled across China.

"People have been advised to stay at home ... if you can't go out to a restaurant, you can't eat lobster," Mr Thompson told 6PR radio.

"I think like all the other exporters, we'll be hoping that things loosen up a bit in China and we can actually start to get it moving again and get the boats back to work."
