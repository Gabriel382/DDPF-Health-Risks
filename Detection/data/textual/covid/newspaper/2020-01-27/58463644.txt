Four people being tested for coronavirus in WA 
 Four people are being tested for the potentially deadly coronavirus in Western Australia, health authorities have confirmed.

Western Australian chief health officer Andrew Robertson said the four cases were under investigation.

"These adults all meet specific travel criteria," he said.

"The risk to the Western Australian community remains low."

WA's Health Department said there were no confirmed cases in the state to date.

The department said results for three low-risk possible cases who were previously tested had all returned negative.

There are five confirmed cases of the virus in Australia so far, with four of them in Sydney and one in Melbourne.

The department said it would continue to test people in the state who have been exposed to the disease and have a "clinically compatible" illness.

"Due to the rapidly evolving nature of this situation, possible cases could arise at any time and the number of tests underway is expected to be fluid," the statement said.

"The Department of Health has issued updated advice to hospitals, emergency departments and community-based GPs to help them identify any potential cases and apply appropriate infection control measures.

"We are continuing to monitor the situation very carefully and there is no need for alarm.

"The Western Australian health system is very well prepared to manage infectious disease situations and has well established systems and processes in place to protect the health of our community."
