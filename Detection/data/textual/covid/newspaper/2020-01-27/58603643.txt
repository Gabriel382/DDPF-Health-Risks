Coronavirus: Recent travellers from Wuhan to UK told to self-isolate 
 Anyone in the UK who has recently arrived from Wuhan - where the deadly coronavirus broke out - is now being urged to "self-isolate".Â  Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that any travellers who have returned from the Chinese city in the last two weeks should stay indoors, avoid contact with other people and contact the NHS 111 service. He added officials are still trying to trace 1,460 people who landed in the UK from the wider Hubei province. Mr Hancock also admitted "we cannot be 100% certain" that the virus does not spread if an infected person has no symptoms. Speaking in the House of Commons, he said: "If you develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of travel from the area, and are now in the UK, call your GP or ring 111 informing them of your symptoms and your recent travel to the city. "Do not leave your home until you have been given advice by a clinician. "The NHS has expert teams in every ambulance service and a number of specialist hospital units with highly trained staff and equipment ready to receive and care for patients with any highly infectious disease including this one."
