Global Stocks Fall as Deadly Virus Spreads 
 Stocks tumbled on Monday and oil prices fell, as the spread of a dangerous virus in China raised investor worries about the global economy.
The sudden appearance of the coronavirus, which has now killed at least 80 people in China and infected others in Europe and the United States, among other countries, has shattered a calm that had settled over financial markets in recent months.
Concerns about the virus were evident on Wall Street on Friday, with shares of airlines and companies dependent on tourism from China particularly hard hit.
On Monday, that selling accelerated. Major stock benchmarks in Europe were down more than 2 percent. While many markets in Asia were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, Tokyoâ€™s benchmark Nikkei 225 index sank 2 percent.


Trading in U.S. stock futures indicated that shares on Wall Street would also open lower.
Oil prices dropped, with the benchmark U.S. crude falling from $1.71 to $52.48 per barrel.
On Friday, the SP 500 declined 0.9 percent, the worst for the index since early October.
