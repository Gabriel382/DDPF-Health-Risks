A Chinese official warned of a shortage of protective masks and suits amid the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak 
 China may be facing a shortage of protective masks and suits as it works to contain the coronavirus outbreak sweeping the country.

Since the outbreak was first identified about a month ago, local governments and public-health officials have recommended protective wear as a preventive measure.

Wang Jiangping, China's vice minister of industry and information technology, said at a news conference reported by The New York Times that Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak, needed 100,000 protective suits a day to outfit citizens, but manufacturers could supply only 30,000 suits a day.

It was discovered only weeks after the outbreak began that the coronavirus could pass among humans via saliva or phlegm.

A doctor previously told the South China Morning Post that medical workers did not have enough protective gear, causing them to catch the virus while treating patients.

The preventive accessories are just one of the country's resources that are being strained during the spread of the virus. Mimi Lau, a reporter at the South China Morning Post, reported that hospitals had reserved test kits for patients displaying the most severe symptoms, which has slowed down diagnoses and created such heightened demand that hospital patients in the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began,Â have compared getting a kit to winning the lottery.

The death toll of the outbreak has hit 80, with more than 2,700 confirmed cases of infection in China by Monday, according to China's National Health Committee.

As cases of the virus have popped up in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not issued a call for employing protective gear, instead recommending standard precautions like hand washing and avoiding sick people.
