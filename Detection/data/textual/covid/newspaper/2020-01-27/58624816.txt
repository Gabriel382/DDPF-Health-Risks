Australian schools ban students who have visited China to curb coronavirus outbreak 
 Australian schools are banning students who have visited China over the summer holidays from attending class without a medical certificate to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus. The measures follow the University of New South Wales confirming one of its students was diagnosed with the virus - marking the fifth confirmed case in Australia. In China, the death toll has risen to 81 with more than 2,400 people infected. There are fears another thousand cases could be confirmed in Wuhan alone. The Chinese Government has committed $13 billion to contain the spread of the virus.
