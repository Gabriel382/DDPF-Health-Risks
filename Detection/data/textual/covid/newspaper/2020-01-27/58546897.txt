Fake news nagpapalala ng epekto ng coronavirus 
 “It’s one thing to take precautionary measures but it’s another to spread fear and hysteria,” ani Garin, dating kalihim ng Department of Health. “These past couple of days, there have been a lot of text messages and social media posts informing the public that there is a Wuhan coronavirus case in this or that hospital. This is a wrong way to help. Akala ng iba, makakatulong ito subalit panic po ang nagiging resulta nito. Panic should not have a place during these times.”

“Huwag mag panic ngunit alamin kung kailan dapat magpakonsulta at ano ang dapat gawin,” ani Garin. “Fake news does not have a place in this world, especially in an outbreak.”

Sinabi ng lady solon na ang kailangan ngayon ay proper hygiene, tama at madalas na paghuhugas ng kamay at tamang pagtatapon ng ginamit na tissue paper at pagtatakip ng bibig at ilong kapag umuubo o bumabahing.

“I call on DOH to immediately come forward and refute every fake news. As the authority on health, every rebuttal regain trust of the people. Unnecessary health misinformation causes fatigue to our health system. This will deprive the real patients of proper medical care.”

“Pushing them away will only make them hide if they have symptoms. Make your time useful by spreading the right advocacies and proper information.”
