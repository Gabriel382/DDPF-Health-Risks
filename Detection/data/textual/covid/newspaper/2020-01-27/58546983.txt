UK Medical Director Does Not Deny Coronavirus May Be in Country, But Says Britain Is ‘Well Prepared' 
 Dr Yvonne Doyle, a medical director and director for health protection at Public Health England, did not reject the assumptions that there could already have been cases of coronavirus infections in the UK, despite no one having been officially diagnosed, but insisted that the country was “well prepared” for a potential outbreak of the virus.

The medical director insisted that Britain has a plan to track those who arrive from Wuhan and other parts of China, adding that although it is not “always possible to find everybody”, the health authorities are making their “best endeavours”.

According to the official, the best way to protect yourself from infection is to follow basic rules of personal hygiene and “keep your hands clean”.
