'Business as usual' for Vic public schools 
 Victorian public school students who travelled to China during the summer break won't be excluded amid fears the deadly corona virus is spreading.

On the advice of health officials, government schools will only expect a student to stay away if they are a confirmed case or have been exposed to someone who has been confirmed to have the virus.

"We're providing advice to our schools that is based on the information that we've been given through the national public health guidelines that have been issued by the commonwealth chief medical officer and the World Health Organisation," education department deputy secretary David Howes told 3AW on Tuesday.

"And that advice is that there is no way to exclude students or staff who are well, even if they have been travelling in China, unless they meet one of two criteria - that they obviously are a confirmed case of coronavirus then we would be requiring that they stay away for 14 days or if they've had close contact with someone who has been a confirmed case."

Mr Howes said schools are exercising caution though and monitoring students who have been travelling overseas.

"Because of course, this issue isn't just limited to students who are coming for China, we provide advice to schools about the normal precautions that they can take around good hygiene, and I'm sure it's good to be getting that extra attention as students return this week," he said.
