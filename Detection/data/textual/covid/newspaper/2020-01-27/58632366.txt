U.S. oil futures fall for 5 sessions in a row to lowest settlement in over 3 months 
 Oil futures fell for a fifth straight session on Monday, sending U.S. prices to their lowest settlement since October. Concerns over the economic impact of the coronavirus has fed expectations for a slowdown in energy demand. March West Texas Intermediate oil CLH20, -1.99% fell $1.05, or 1.9%, to settle at $53.14 barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the lowest front-month contract finish since Oct. 15, according to FactSet data.
