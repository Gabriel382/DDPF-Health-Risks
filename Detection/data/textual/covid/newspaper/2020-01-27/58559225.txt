Ontario Confirms Second Presumptive Case of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 
 TORONTO — Today, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, confirmed that the wife of the province's first case of Wuhan novel coronavirus has tested positive for the virus at Ontario's public health laboratory. Since arriving in Toronto with her husband, this individual has been in self-isolation.

"We are working alongside Toronto Public Health, who has been in regular contact with the individual during their self-isolation period," said Dr. Williams. "Given the fact that she has been in self-isolation, the risk to Ontarians remains low."
