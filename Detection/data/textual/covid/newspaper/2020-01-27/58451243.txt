Manila says 'no confirmed' case of new coronavirus 
 MANILA - The Philippine capital does not have a confirmed case of the new coronavirus, its health department said Monday.

The Manila Health Department issued the statement after unverified information were posted online regarding an alleged novel coronavirus case in Binondo, Manila.

It, however, said that a Chinese man who works at a Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) was diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia.

The POGO worker was hospitalized at Metropolitan Hospital last Saturday due to fever and cough and is now well and without fever, according to Manila City Health Officer Dr. Arnold Pangan.

"The patient has fever and cough but negative on history of travel to Wuhan, China, and no history of exposure to a host or positive case," Pangan said.

The coronavirus scare on social media prompted several schools Manila to suspend classes, the city government said.

Mayor Isko Moreno, meantime, urged the public to avoid sharing misinformation and to be vigilant.

"Tayo po ay makinig sa mga lathalain, panawagan ng mga tamang tao at ahensya ng gobyerno," he said.

"Kayo rin, tayong lahat, huwag kayong matatakot kapag kayo ay may ubo. Mas maganda magpagamot at magpa-check up."
