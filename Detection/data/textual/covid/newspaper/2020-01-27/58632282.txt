Coronavirus: Can China contain outbreak that has infected 2,700 people? 
 Around 1,500 people have come back to the UK from virus-hit Wuhan since 10 January.

It is those people, Health Secretary Matt Hacock said, who should isolate themselves as it is not certain whether the coronavirus can be spread by people who are not displaying symptoms.

His announcement came as the death toll climbed above 80.

And one Briton trapped in the locked-down city has told us he wants to get back to the UK but has not heard from the Foreign Office.
