More than 70 people tested for coronavirus in UK as death toll rises in China 
 Health officials have announced 73 people have now been tested for Coronavirus in the UK.

The department for health and social care has said all the tests have come back negative.

It said in a statement on Twitter: “As of 2PM on Monday 27 January 2020, a total of 73 tests have concluded: 73 were confirmed negative, 0 positive.

“Updated data will be published at 2PM daily until further notice.”

The update comes as the death toll from the virus outbreak rises to 81, after an 80-year-old woman in Hainan whose family arrived from Wuhan died.

The number of confirmed cases in China currently stands at around 2,744 as the Chinese city of Wuhan – where the outbreak started – continues to be locked down.

Britain’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, recently said “there may well be cases in the UK at some stage”.

He said: "I am working closely with the other UK chief medical officers.

"We all agree that the risk to the UK public remains low, but there may well be cases in the UK at some stage.

"We have tried and tested measures in place to respond. The UK is well-prepared for these types of incidents, with excellent readiness against infectious diseases.

"We have global experts monitoring the situation around the clock and have a strong track record of managing new forms of infectious disease.”
