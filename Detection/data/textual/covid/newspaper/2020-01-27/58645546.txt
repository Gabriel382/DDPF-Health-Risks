Re: KNUST students successfully create vaccine for coronavirus, Cote D’Ivoire patient cured 
 The management of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) has rebutted a false story circulating on social media indicating that some students of the University have created a vaccine for the deadly and fast-spreading coronavirus.

 

 In the publication, some KNUST students discovered the vaccine for the virus and had cured a patient from Cote D’Ivoire successfully.

 

 The project was said to be under the supervision of one Professor Dr. Israel Nluki.

 

 But in a press statement by the institution Public Affairs Directorate, the University has no association with the said professor.

 

 “...we wish to state that, the person alleged to have supervised the purported project (Professor Dr. Israel Nluki) has no affiliations with KNUST. Management thus urges the public to disregard such publication,” the statement read.
