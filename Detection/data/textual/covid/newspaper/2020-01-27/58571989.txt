Gasoline, crude prices falling as coronavirus fears tick up 
 Prices at the pump are continuing to fall because of crude oil values hitting five-month lows Monday morning amid fears of the coronavirus spreading and a potential global oil glut.



                                                                	The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded in the Houston area dipped more than 4 cents in the last week down to $2.14. The national average also fell by about 4 cents to $2.50 per gallon, according to GasBuddy, which tracks fuel pricing nationwide.

The spread of the virus in China and even into the U.S. is putting a dent in crude oil and fuel markets in Asia and potentially beyond.

"While the national average could fall into the $2.30s before all is said and done, the downward move likely won't last much more than a few more weeks.
