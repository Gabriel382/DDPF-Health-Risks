Fifth Case Of Coronavirus In US Occurs As Death Toll Climbs In China 
 Three more Americans have been diagnosed with coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected patients to five in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday.
 While the agency deemed the risk for Americans to be low, there are an estimated 3,000 cases in China, according to The New York Times. The three newest U.S. cases were in one Arizona patient and two California patients who had traveled back from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus is believed to have originated.
 
 Wuhan is essentially on lockdown as the country’s death toll rises to at least 80.
   The virus attacks infected patients’ respiratory systems, causing shortness of breath, coughing, and tightness in the chest, along with fever. It is most deadly to young children and elderly adults. (RELATED: CDC Confirms Wuhan Coronavirus Case In Chicago As China Locks Down Travel In More Cities)
