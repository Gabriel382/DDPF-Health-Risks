Deadly coronavirus may already be in UK - top doctor warns 
 The deadly coronavirus that has killed 80 people in China is likely to already be in the UK, according to England's director for health protection. Dr Yvonne Doyle told Sky News: "The most likely place that we're going to find a case is someone who is in the country already." And asked if there could be cases already in Britain, she said: "I would expect so." Dr Doyle added that the NHS is ready to tackle the virus, which has infected nearly 3,000 people, and a screening technique has been developed to detect it. She also warned people should be keenly aware of personal hygiene, saying people should: "Use a tissue, throw it away, wash your hands. "People will be wary of what they touch but actually the important thing is its droplets and hands. So, keep your hands clean. Wash them with soap," she added. Professor Robin Shattock, infection specialist at Imperial College London, also told Sky News that he believes it is likely the UK will see cases of coronavirus. Speaking to Kay Burley @Breakfast, he also said that a vaccine is being developed in the UK but will take a "period of months" if it is funded correctly, and then "significantly longer" than that to distribute it. Professor Shattock said there could be a second wave of the virus later in the year, or that it may even eventually peter out. "There are still many unknowns about the virus, and how it may spread, it is important to be ready for any possible scenario." But he said he is "not worried" and that the public should not be "panicked" by the virus. "It still needs to placed in context with influenza," Professor Shattock said. "At the moment there have been 80 deaths (from coronavirus)... but influenza season kills about 60,000 people globally. "We need a sense of proportion."
