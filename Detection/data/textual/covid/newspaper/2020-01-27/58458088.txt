Four people being tested for coronavirus in WA 
 Four people are being tested for the potentially deadly coronavirus in Western Australia, health authorities have confirmed.

Western Australian chief health officer Andrew Robertson said the four cases were under investigation.

"These adults all meet specific travel criteria," he said.

"The risk to the Western Australian community remains low."

WA's Health Department said there were no confirmed cases in the state to date.

The department said results for three low-risk possible cases who were previously tested had all returned negative.

There has been only one confirmed case of the virus in Australia so far.

More to come.
