China's Biggest League of Legends Tournament Delayed Due to Coronavirus 
 The top League of Legends tournament has been delayed to ensure the safety of all its attendees in China from the coronavirus outbreak.

The League of Legends Pro League (LPL) was due to return for its second week of matches in China on February 5, 2020. However, the LPL’s English Twitter account has now announced that the tournament has been postponed with no new date for its return currently set.

The reason for the delay is the outbreak of the highly contagious coronavirus in mainland China. The LPL is one of many professional sporting events held in China that have either been delayed until March 2020 or moved to another country due to the virus.

It was announced last week that 70,000 Chinese movie theatres were also being closed for the duration of the coronavirus outbreak.

The coronavirus has been confirmed to be deadly. The BBC reports that it has killed over 80 people, with nearly 3000 more people confirmed to have caught the virus. It has spread to South Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia, Australia, Nepal, and as far as the USA, Canada, and France.

Since the coronavirus spread, sales of the strategy simulation game Plague Inc. soared, due to it being a game about containing a deadly pathogen. This caused developer Ndemic Creations to release a statement saying that the game is “not a scientific model” for how disease spreads.

Ndemic Creations added that people should visit the World Health Organization’s website to get a real idea of how viruses like the coronavirus spread and how to best avoid catching them.
