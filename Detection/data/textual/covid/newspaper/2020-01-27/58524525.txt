Over 1.000 crypto miners given licenses in Iran

Iran has given more than 1.000 licenses to cryptocurrency miners in the country, an official from ICT Guild Organization has said.
The country has long been attractive to miners due to cheap power: only $0.11 per KWh of energy. However, the crypto mining industry has the potential to add $8.5 billion to Iran’s economy.
