Two Patients at RSHS Suspected of Contracting Coronavirus 
 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The managing director of Hasan Sadikin Hospital (RSHS) in Bandung, Nina Susana Dewi, said there were two patients in the hospital treated for suspected coronavirus or Novel Coronavirus (NcoV). The two patients, a Chinese national and an Indonesian, are treated in the hospital’s Kemuning Special Infection Isolation Room. The Chinese national, a male, came to the hospital on January 26, 2020, at around 13:43 local time. “He carries a reference letter from Cahya Kawaluyaan, which says acute pharyngitis of respiratory tract,” Nina said in Bandung on Monday, January 27, 2020. The Indonesian patient was transferred from Borromeus Hospital in Bandung to RSHS also on Sunday. Nina could not yet confirm as to whether the two had contracted the coronavirus, as the samples of the patients were just sent today to the Health Ministry’s Research and Development Agency, which has the authority to confirm the cases. “The results will be out in 24 hours, that is if there are no additional lab checks,” she said.  AMINUDDIN
