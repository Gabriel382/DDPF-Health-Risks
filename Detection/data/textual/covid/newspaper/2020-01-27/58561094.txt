China extends New Year holiday as coronavirus death toll jumps to 81 
 Chinese authorities have decided to extend the Lunar New Year holiday by several days to “reduce mass gatherings" and “block the spread” of a mysterious new virus that has sickened more than 2,700 people and killed at least 81.It was the latest in a series of desperate measures aimed at stopping a pneumonia-like infection that’s believed to have originated in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people that is under a transportation ban. Public transit in 16 other cities have also been suspended while many tourist attractions, including Shanghai Disneyland and sections of the Great Wall of China, have been temporarily closed. The official end of the New Year holiday, also known as the Spring Festival, was pushed back from Thursday to Sunday, the Chinese government announced in a statement Monday. In Shanghai, however, the holiday was extended to Feb. 9. The newly discovered infection is part of a family of coronaviruses that causes respiratory illness in people circulating among animals. Authorities believe the outbreak is linked to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, where the first cases were confirmed late last month, but the new virus has since been spreading from human to human.The vast majority of cases and deaths have been reported in central China’s Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, and surrounding areas. But a few dozen cases have been confirmed outside the country, including five in the U.S., five in Australia and eight in Thailand. With News Wire Services
