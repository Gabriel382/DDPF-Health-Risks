BEIJING (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 27th January, 2020) China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on Monday that it had allocated 300 million Yuan ($43.2 million) for the construction of hospitals in Wuhan to provide treatment to those affected by the new coronavirus.
"The NDRC, in accordance with the mechanism for the prevention and control of the spread of coronavirus, approved the allocation of 300 million yuan from the state budget. The funds will be spent on the construction of hospitals ... to treat patients with pneumonia caused by the new type of coronavirus," the statement said.
In addition, part of the allocated funds will be used to purchase the necessary medical equipment.

 The two hospitals will have a capacity to accommodate over 2,000 patients.
