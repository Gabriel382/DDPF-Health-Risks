SmartTraveller registration cancelled before coronavirus outbreak 
 It is understood DFAT did not make an official announcement about its decision to cancel Smartraveller registration and an ABC radio host mistakenly advised Australians to register their travel through the website on Monday morning.

A "travel tip" printed on current passports also advises citizens to register their trips with Smartraveller.
The Smartraveller website said the change had not been made for budgetary reasons, but aimed "to improve our response time, which is absolutely essential to helping Australians in need who are involved in crises overseas".
"Very few Australians ever registered their details with us. The data we received was often incomplete or inaccurate," the website said. "This delayed getting help to those in need."

It said most people who needed consular help either contacted the embassy or DFAT themselves, or a family member did so on their behalf.

"We encourage you to leave your itinerary and contact details with your family, friends or employer and stay in touch when youâ€™re overseas," the website said.
"If a crisis occurs, you can either contact us directly or your family, friends, employer, travel agent or tour operator will contact us on your behalf.
"The new system reflects this reality and allows us to focus on Australians most in need."

The website said the text in the current series of Australian passports was written in 2013 and that the next series of passports "will not include a reference to registration".
Comment has been sought from Senator Payne and DFAT.
