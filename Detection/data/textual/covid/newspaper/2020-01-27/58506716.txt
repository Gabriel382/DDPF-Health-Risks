Foreign Office preparing to extract British nationals from Wuhan amid coronavirus outbreak 
 The Foreign Office has today declared it is drafting plans to extract British nationals from Wuhan left stranded by the coronavirus outbreak.

The government confirmed it is working on making an "option available" for Britons to leave Hubei province which has effectively been shut down by Chinese authorities in a bid to contain the virus.

The announcement came after Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, suggested UK citizens could be airlifted from China.
