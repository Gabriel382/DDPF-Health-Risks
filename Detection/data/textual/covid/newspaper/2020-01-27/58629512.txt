Four tests for coronavirus in Qld negative 
 Queensland says tests on four people suspected of carrying coronavirus have come back negative

Tests on four people suspected of carrying the deadly coronavirus in Queensland have all come back negative.

The state's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said Queensland remains free of 2019-nCoV cases, so far, after the tests were done on Monday.

Nationally, there are five confirmed cases: four in New South Wales and one in Victoria.

The disease began in the central China city of Wuhan in December last year and has killed at least 81 people, and infected more than 2750 globally, most of them in China.

Australian authorities are urging anyone who has developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of travel to China should see their GP immediately.

People are also being told to call ahead and advise the clinic of their symptoms so precautions can be taken.
