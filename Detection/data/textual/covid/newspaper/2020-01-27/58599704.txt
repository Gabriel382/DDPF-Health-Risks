Ontario’s second coronavirus case confirmed 
 Ontario’s second case of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus has been confirmed in Ontario.

The province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams confirmed the case Monday morning, describing the patient as the wife of Ontario’s first victim, a man in his 50s currently recovering in Toronto’s Sunnybrook hospital.

“We are working alongside Toronto Public Health, who has been in regular contact with the individual during their self-isolation period,” Williams said.

“Given the fact that she has been in self-isolation, the risk to Ontarians remains low.”

The man’s family’s members have been in ‘self-isolation’ since he returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan last Tuesday aboard China Southern Airlines Flight number CZ311.

A press conference is scheduled for later this morning at Queen’s Park.

The highly-contagious coronavirus strain, designated as 2019-nCoV first emerged late last year in the east-central Chinese city of Wuhan.

The virus quickly spread, with the first confirmed death reported on January 9 by Chinese officials.

The reported death toll sits at 81 as of Monday morning out of 2,876 confirmed cases worldwide, Chinese officials say.

All of the deaths were contained within China.

The outbreak prompted officials to cancel Lunar New Year celebrations across China, and quarantine a number of cities within Hubei province, including Wuhan.

As of Monday morning, 41 cases have been reported in 11 countries outside of China, including eight in Thailand and five each in the United States and Australia.
