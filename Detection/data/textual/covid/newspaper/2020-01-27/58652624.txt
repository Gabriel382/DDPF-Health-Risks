‘Reconsider travel’: US advises Americans against travelling to China as first death from coronavirus confirmed in Beijing 
 The US State Department has urged citizens to “reconsider” travelling to China in its newest advisory amid ongoing deadly coronavirus outbreak as another person fell victim to the disease in the Chinese capital of Beijing.

    
The advisory warns Americans about an “increased risk” of infection and explicitly calls on them not to travel to the Hubei province – the epicenter of the outbreak that was essentially quarantined by the Chinese authorities. It also said that all non-emergency US personnel and their family members were ordered to leave the troubled province last week, thus confirming the earlier reports. 
Further advices to those, who would still travel to China despite the warnings, include such recommendations as avoiding contact with sick people as well as any animals, animal markets and animal products like uncooked meat.

The advisory comes as China’s capital of Beijing confirmed the first death from the deadly respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus named 2019-nCoV, bringing the total death toll in the country to 82. Hundreds of new infections are also confirmed every day and the number of cases confirmed countrywide has surpassed 2,800.
The virus already spread beyond China’s borders with cases confirmed in 15 countries, including Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia as well as France, Canada and the US itself. Beijing also most recently revealed that the disease can spread before any symptoms could be detected, sparking concerns among some US medics.
