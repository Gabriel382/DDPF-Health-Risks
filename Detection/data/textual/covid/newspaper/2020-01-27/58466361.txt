No charter flight yet as Federal Government assesses evacuating Australians at risk of coronavirus 
 Foreign Minister Marise Payne says the Federal Government is exploring "all opportunities" to help evacuate Australians trapped in Hubei, China, and at risk of coronavirus.

The ABC has confirmed that more than 100 Australian children are currently trapped in that area, which is now in lockdown.

While other nations are reportedly trying to evacuate their citizens with chartered flights, Senator Payne said there were limitations to the assistance the Australian Government could provide because Australia does not have a consular presence in the region.

She said Australian consular officials in Beijing were in close consultation with Chinese authorities.

"It is, I think, very important to appreciate that there are limitations to what we can do," Senator Payne said.

"We don't have a consular presence on the ground so getting in to help, given the travel restrictions, continues to be a significant difficulty.

"We also have to remind ourselves that the Chinese Government has placed the travel restrictions in place in these areas to contain the coronavirus outbreak itself."

Earlier today, NSW Health has confirmed the state's fourth case of coronavirus in Sydney after several schools warned pupils whose families have been to China would need a doctor's certificate before term one.

The latest case, which brings the number of confirmed cases in Australia to five, is a 21-year-old woman.

More to come.
