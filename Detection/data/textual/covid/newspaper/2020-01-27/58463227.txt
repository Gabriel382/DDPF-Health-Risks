Four possible coronavirus infections under investigation in WA 
 A spokeswoman for the WA Department of Health would not say whether the people waiting for test results were being kept in isolation.
The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.
It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called the outbreak a grave situation.
The death toll from the coronavirus has risen to 80 with more than 2700 confirmed cases, China's government said on Monday, after the health minister warned that the virus's ability to "spread is getting stronger."
Dr Robertson said testing would continue to be arranged for people who meet exposure criteria and have a clinically compatible illness.

"Due to the rapidly evolving nature of this situation, possible cases could arise at any time and the number of tests underway is expected to be fluid," Dr Robertson said.

"If any illness is confirmed as being caused by the novel coronavirus it will be reported to the Australian Government who will also forward this information to the World Health Organization."
The Department of Health issued updated advice to hospitals, emergency departments and community-based GPs to help them identify any potential cases and apply appropriate infection control measures.
"We are continuing to monitor the situation very careful and there is no need for alarm," Dr Robertson said. "The Western Australian health system is very well prepared to manage infectious disease situations and have well established systems and processes in place to protect the health of our community."
