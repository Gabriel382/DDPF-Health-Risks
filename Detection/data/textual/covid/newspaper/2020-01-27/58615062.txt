Coronavirus: Government Orders People Returning From Wuhan To 'Self-Isolate' 
 The UK government has urged 1,500 people who have returned from Wuhan in recent weeks to “self-isolate” as ministers stepped-up moves to tackle the spread of coronavirus.

In an update to MPs about the outbreak, health secretary Matt Hancock said the risk to the UK population is “low” and the country is “well prepared and well equipped” to respond if required.

But Hancock said officials could not be 100% certain that the virus is not spread by people who are not displaying symptoms.

In new public health guidance, the secretary state said people returning from the Chinese city in the last 14 days should stay indoors and contact NHS 111 phone number. He added there were 1,460 people “we are seeking to locate”.

Hancock said: “Coronaviruses do not usually spread if people don’t have symptoms – but we cannot be 100% certain.

“From today, we are therefore asking anyone in the UK who has returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days to self-isolate. Stay indoors and avoid contact with other people – and to contact NHS 111.

“If you are in Northern Ireland, you should phone your GP.

“If you develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of travel to the area, and are now in the UK, call your GP or ring 111 informing them of your symptoms and your recent travel to the city.

“Do not leave your home until you have been given advice by a clinician.”

Hancock said efforts are still going on to trace people who have arrived in the UK from Wuhan and the surrounding area, adding: “Having eliminated those who we know have since left the country, there are 1,460 people we are seeking to locate.
