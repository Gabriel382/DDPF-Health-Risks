Stocks tumble amid growing coronavirus fears 
 Global stock markets sank Monday amid growing fears about the Chinese coronavirus that has killed dozens and spread to more than 10 countries.

The MSCI All-Country World Index tracking stocks in more than 40 countries fell 0.42 to its lowest point in two weeks after the death toll from the virus rose to 81 and three new cases were confirmed in the US this weekend.

“The coronavirus is an economic and financial shock,” Bannockburn Securities chief market strategist Marc Chandler told clients, according to Reuters. “The extent of that shock still needs to be assessed, but it could provide the spark for an arguably long-overdue adjustment in the capital markets.”

Futures trading indicated all three major US stock indexes would continue Friday’s decline and shares dropped in Europe and Asia as the expanding coronavirus threat continued to roil investors. The disease has sickened nearly 2,800 people around the world and cases have been confirmed in about a dozen countries, including the US, Australia, France and Japan.

Dow futures were down 405.00 points, or 1.4 percent, at 28,528.00 as of 7:05 a.m., while Nasdaq futures had dipped 1.8 percent to 8,976.75 and SP futures recently dropped 1.4 percent to 3,247.50.

London’s FTSE 100 index was recently down 2.1 percent at 7,425.47 as Paris’s CAC 40 dropped 2.2 percent to 5,891.28 and Germany’s blue-chip DAX index sank 2.2 percent to 13,269.06.

Tokyo’s Nikkei index fell 2 percent to mark its largest single-day fall in five months. Several other Asian markets were closed Monday for the Lunar New Year holiday, during which many people have had to scrap travel plans because of the quarantine of more than a dozen Chinese cities.

But Chinese stocks reportedly saw their worst-ever end to the lunar year last week with the Shanghai Composite Index closing down about 2.8 percent at 2,976.53 on Thursday.

The Chinese government gave the Lunar New Year holiday a three-day extension to Feb. 2 in an effort to slow down the virus’s spread. The outbreak has led some large companies to shut down or have employees to work from home, and public attractions such as Shanghai’s and Hong Kong’s Disneyland theme parks have temporarily closed.
