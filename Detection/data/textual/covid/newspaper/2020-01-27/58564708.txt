United States Government Bond 10Y 
 The US benchmark 10-year yield dropped to 1.618% on Monday, its lowest level since October 10th, due to growing concerns about the economic impact from a coronavirus outbreak in China which has already killed 81 people and spread to many other countries.

The United States Government Bond 10Y is expected to trade at 1.87 percent by the end of this quarter, according to Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations. Looking forward, we estimate it to trade at 2.05 in 12 months time.
