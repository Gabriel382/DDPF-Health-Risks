Australians should be 'alert but not alarmed' over coronavirus 
 The Australian public should be "alert but not alarmed" over fears of the deadly coronavirus says the Institute of Public Affairsâ€™ Gideon Rozner. Nearly 2,000 people have now contracted the virus in China where 56 people are confirmed to have died. "I think we should do everything we can obviously to prevent the spread and to take it seriously," Mr Rozner told Sky News host Paul Murray. "I just feel like we've been her before with SARS, with the swine flu, with bird flu," he said. "The time for panicking and getting ahead of ourselves is not quite yet". Image: Associated Press
