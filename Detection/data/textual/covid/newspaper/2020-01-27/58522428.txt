BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is considering evacuating German citizens from the Chinese region affected by coronavirus, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Monday. 
“We are now also considering a possible evacuation of all Germans who are willing to leave,” Maas told a news conference, adding that a team from the German embassy in Beijing would arrive in Wuhan - the Chinese city where the coronavirus outbreak began - later in the day to help Germans there. 
Maas said Germans should avoid all travel to China that was not absolutely necessary.
