Chinese premier Li Keqiang in Wuhan to lead emergency efforts as coronavirus deaths in China rise to 80 
 Given the restriction on travel, the governments of the US, France, Japan, South Korea, and Australia are working to evacuate their diplomats and citizens from Wuhan. A 230-seat charter flight carrying Americans is expected to depart Wuhan on Tuesday and land in San Francisco.

The Foreign Office has updated its travel guidance to advise against all travel to Hubei Province and states: "If you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so."

The virus has spread across China, infecting people of all ages, including a nine-month-old infant in Beijing, in the first confirmed case of a baby falling ill. Cases have also been discovered in more than a dozen countries, with the US now reporting five total  infected with the virus.
