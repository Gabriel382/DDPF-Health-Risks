Coronavirus: China premier Li Keqiang visits Wuhan as death toll hits 80 – live updates 
 We are still being advised to stay in the house as it’s the safest place and only go out when absolutely necessary. My biggest worry is my grandmother who suffers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 

This city is pretty much a ghost town apart from the odd person walking the streets to get necessities, some cars are out and about.

We have enough supplies for now probably enough food for the next 2 weeks, I’ve got enough masks for the amount of time I think I’ll be outside, I’m trying to go out as little as possible with my grandmothers condition I don’t want to jeopardise her health.

The response from the UK government has been an absolute joke

They were helpful at the beginning, they put us in touch with a doctor for more medication for my grandmother, but since then they have been quiet, we have not even had a hello from any of the British consulate staff in Wuhan. I presume they have been evacuated in secret because they seem to have left Wuhan, the advice from the embassy is to keep checking the travel advisory website for updates.

The update is absolutely pathetic “get out if you can” how can we? We are on lockdown.

The FCO have been absolutely shocking in their response.

The school are desperately trying to help with the situation as they fear for my grandmothers health if she was to contract this virus.
