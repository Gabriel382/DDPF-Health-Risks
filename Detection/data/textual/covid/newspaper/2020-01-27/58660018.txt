Canadian Govt Issues 'Avoid All Travel' Alert to China's Hubei Province Due to Virus Outbreak 
 Ottawa updated on Monday its travel advisory by urging Canadians to "avoid all travel" to the Chinese province of Hubei, including "the cities of Wuhan, Huanggang and Ezhou" as a measure to stop spreading the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus dubbed 2019-nCoV.

​The US Department of State also updated its travel advisory earlier in the day, calling on Americans to reassess their travel plans to China due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Located in the central Chinese province of Hubei, the city first reported an outbreak of a previously unknown strain of pneumonia-like disease in late December. Last week, Wuhan and two other cities — Huanggang and Ezhou — were completely quarantined, with people prohibited to leave or enter.

The current coronavirus outbreak is reportedly believed to have kicked off at a Wuhan seafood market.
