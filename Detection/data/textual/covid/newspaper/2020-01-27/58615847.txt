New Haven Mayor Justin Eliker, along with other city and university officials, held a conference call to talk about the potentially deadly virus.
â€œWhile the two cases in Connecticut are influenza cases we are in the midst of flu season, we want to take all precautions to make absolutely sure they do not also [have] coronavirus so as to ensure the health and safety of all residents," Eliker said.
Health officials are urging people to wash hands, avoid close contact with anyone who's sick and clean surfaces.
They said the threat for the coronavirus in Connecticut remains low.
