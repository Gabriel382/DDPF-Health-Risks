Johnson & Johnson scientific officer confident of creating a coronavirus vaccine 
 Johnson & Johnson's chief scientific officer, Dr. Paul Stoffels, told CNBC on Monday that he believes the drugmaker can create a vaccine in the coming months to fight the fast-spreading coronavirus.

"We have dozens of scientists working on this so we're pretty confident we can get something made that will work and stay active for the longer term," said Stoffels, also vice chairman of the executive committee, in a "Squawk Box" interview.

Chinese officials said there are now more than 2,800 confirmed cases of the flu-like coronavirus, with the death toll rising to 81. It was first identified in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province last month.

More countries are also reporting coronavirus cases, including the U.S., which on Sunday confirmed a fifth case.

Several companies, including Walt Disney's Shanghai Disney, are suspending operations until further notice during the normally festive week-long Lunar New Year holiday to prevent the outbreak from spreading. Starbucks and McDonald's also closed stores in Hubei province.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is set to sink about 400 points at Wall Street's open on Monday. U.S. stock futures were under severe pressure, following stock markets around the world lower, as the cornonvirus outbreak widened.
