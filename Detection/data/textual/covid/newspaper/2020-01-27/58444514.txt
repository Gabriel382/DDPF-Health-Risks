NSW Health works to verify if coronavirus is infectious during incubation 
 The New South Wales Chief Medical Officer says the health body is working to clarify reports the coronavirus is infectious even during incubation. China’s National Health Commission said overnight that unlike similar disease SARS, the virus is infectious during incubation and the incubation period could be as long as 14 days. Kerry Chant told Sky News NSW health is “working together” with health authorities across the world to verify China’s claims. “That is a very important piece of information – if it’s verified,’ she said. “It is different from our experience with other coronaviruses… so that is something we are working rapidly as we speak to verify because that obliviously has ramifications for our response.”
