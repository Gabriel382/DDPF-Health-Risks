Dow utilities index set to snap longest win streak in 28 years, despite Treasury yield dip and stock market selloff 
 The utilities sector is slipping Monday, putting it on track to snap a long winning streak, although the conditions that helped prolong the win streak--falling Treasury yields and coronavirus-induced stock market weakness--accelerated. The Dow Jones Utility Average DJU, -0.23% slipped 0.2%, after rising 7.3% amid a 12-session win streak through Friday. That win streak is the longest such streak since the 12-day stretch ending July 15, 1992. The SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF XLU, -0.26% eased 0.3% to put it in danger of snapping an 11-day win streak, which would be the longest since the 12-day win streak ending June 2, 2017. Among the more-active joint components, shares of AES Corp. AES, -1.64% lost 1.6%, Exelon Corp. EXC, -0.59% gave up 0.5% and CenterPoint Energy Inc. CNP, -0.85% fell 0.7%, while Southern Co. SO, +0.40% gained 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.15% tumbled 331 points, or 1.1%, toward a fifth-straight decline, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -4.34% lost 7.5 basis points to a 3 1/2-month low of 1.606%. Utilities tend to perform well when Treasury yields fall, because investors tend to treat the sector as a bond proxy given the companies' relatively high dividend and stable earnings. That also makes utilities a defensive sector. The energy sector ETF's dividend yield is 2.80%, compared with the implied yield for the S&P 500 SPX, -1.18% of 1.84%.
