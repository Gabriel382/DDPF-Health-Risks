Ombudsman: Indonesians` Lives Far More Important Than Investment 
 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Indonesian Ombudsman Commissioner La Ode Ida said that the protection of Indonesian citizen's lives is far more important than freeing the entry of Chinese workers to Indonesia in the name of investment. "The source of the deadly virus has been proven from China, and the Indonesian government is obliged to protect its citizens from the danger of virus contamination which may be carried by Chinese workers or tourists." Ida conveyed his message through a press release in Jakarta, Monday, January 27, 2020.The appeal was issued regarding coronavirus that infected Wuhan Province, China in early January 2020. A total of 56 people died due to the virus attack. The former Deputy of Regional Representative Council (DPD) hopes that Indonesia can avoid the coronavirus contamination which has infected and killed many citizens in China. The coronavirus has also spread to a number of countries, including Singapore and Thailand.According to Ida, almost every day the workers from China have entered Indonesia especially in Southeast Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi. Indonesian Ombudsman in 2018 has conducted investigations in several regions and found they were the workers in foreign smelters of China.Ida asked the government to issue a temporary ban of arrival for Chinese workers and tourists to avoid transmission of coronavirus in Indonesia, which has yet to be cured. Workers from China who had already been in Indonesia are soon to be recorded and specifically inspected to ensure they are free of the deadly coronavirus.Antara | Safira Andini (Intern Translator)
