Coronavirus: Foreign Office preparing to extract British nationals from Wuhan 
 The Foreign Office is drafting plans to extract British nationals stranded by the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.

The Government confirmed on Monday that it is working on making an "option available" for Britons to leave Hubei province, which has effectively been shut down by Chinese authorities in a bid to contain the virus.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We continue to monitor developments closely and are in close touch with the Chinese authorities. The safety and security of British nationals is always our primary concern."

The Foreign Office recently updated its guidance to "advise against all travel to Hubei province", which has been on lockdown for several days.

But the guidance also added: "If you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak."

Other countries including France, the United States and Japan have already mobilised plans to remove their citizens from Wuhan. The Spanish government also said on Monday it was planning to repatriate its citizens.

The announcement came after Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, suggested UK citizens could be airlifted from China.

Asked if he supported flying Britons back from Wuhan and elsewhere, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday: "I think I would be very sympathetic and I'm sure the Foreign Office would be too."
