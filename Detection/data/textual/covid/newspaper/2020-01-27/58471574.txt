DOH warns vs eating raw meat, exotic animals amid coronavirus outbreak 
 MANILA, Philippines — Skip raw meat and exotic food for now as the Department of Health (DOH) warned Monday against their consumption in the midst of a new coronavirus outbreak.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III urged the public to stop eating animals like dogs, cats, rats, snakes, and lizards, among others.

But if eating exotic animals cannot be avoided, the DOH chief said people must make sure they are thoroughly cooked especially that the coronavirus is sensitive to heat.

“Yung mga ahas, ‘yung mga bayawak, ‘yun pong mga lizards, ‘yan mga ‘yan kinakain. Ginagawang adobo. Masarap, nakatikim na ako pero lutong-luto,” Duque said in a press briefing in Malacañang.

“Talagang kailangang iluto mo kasi sensitive naman itong mga coronaviruses sa init. So pagka I think 53 degrees Centigrade, they will be neutralized.”

Duque stressed eating raw dishes like “kilawin” (a dish prepared by cooking fresh meat in vinegar) should also be stopped in the meantime.

Many human illnesses started from animals, Duque explained, citing the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), African swine fever (ASF), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV originated in China’s Wuhan City where an array of wild animals like bats, snakes, and wolf pups, among others, are reportedly sold and eaten.
