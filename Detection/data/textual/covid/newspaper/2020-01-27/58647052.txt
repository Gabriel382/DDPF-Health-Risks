United Airlines closely watching coronavirus crisis as stock falls 
 Executives at United Airlines are closely monitoring the rapidly developing coronavirus crisis in China as the company's stock price fell more than 5 percent on Monday amid a broader market decline driven by concerns about what impact the virus might have on the global economy.

The coronavirus is of particular concern to Chicago-based United because it is the U.S.-based carrier with the most flights to and from China, as well as other major cities in Asia, including Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong and Singapore.â€¦
