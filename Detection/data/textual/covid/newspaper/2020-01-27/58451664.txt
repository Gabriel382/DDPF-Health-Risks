Tokyo stocks open sharply lower, yen rises amid coronavirus scare 
 TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Tokyo stocks opened sharply lower Monday, with the Nikkei tumbling over 2 percent at one point, as concerns prevailed that the spread of a new coronavirus originating in China would disrupt the global economy.

In the first 15 minutes of trading, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 454.78 points, or 1.91 percent, from Friday to 23,372.40. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was down 27.66 points, or 1.60 percent, at 1,702.78.

Investors fled to safe-haven assets such as the yen, whose appreciation against the U.S. dollar hit export-related issues, including machinery makers. Air transportations and marine transportation issues were among other decliners.

At 9 a.m., the dollar fetched 108.80-81 yen compared with 109.22-32 yen in New York and 109.54-55 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Friday.

The euro was quoted at $1.1025-1025 and 119.96-120.00 yen against $1.1020-1030 and 120.44-54 yen in New York and $1.1050-1051 and 121.04-08 yen in Tokyo late Friday afternoon.
