Two more possible coronavirus patients being monitored in New York 
 Two more New Yorkers have been tested as possible coronavirus patients, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday.

Samples for nine people from the Empire State have been sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since the outbreak began — with four coming back negative and five still pending.

On Sunday, Cuomo had said seven cases had been sent, with three proving negative and four still up in the air.

“These five individuals remain in isolation as their samples are tested at CDC,” Cuomo said. “While the risk for New Yorkers is currently low, we are still working to keep everyone informed, prepared and safe.”

There are no confirmed cases in New York of the virus, that has which has killed 82 in China, where the epidemic broke out last month.

The CDC has said there is no cure for the ailment. But viruses can generally be prevented by washing one’s hand, and avoiding touching one’s eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands or coming in close contact with people who are sick.
