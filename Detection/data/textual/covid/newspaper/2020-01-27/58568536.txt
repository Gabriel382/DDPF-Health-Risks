PAGCOR orders POGOs to quarantine employees from virus-hit areas 
 MANILA - The Philippines' gaming regulator on Monday ordered offshore gaming firms in the country to impose a 10-day quarantine on employees coming from countries affected by outbreaks of the novel coronavirus (nCoV).

After ordering Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) to "exercise extreme caution" in screening employees, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp (PAGCOR) said even stricter measures were needed.

"Another Order was issued today to impose a 10-day quarantine on all newly-hired and returning employees from countries with reported nCoV cases," PAGCOR said in a statement.

Most POGOs cater to clients in mainland China and employ Chinese nationals.

"Although the World Health Organization has not yet declared a global emergency, the Philippine government has tightened the noose on the entry of workers and tourists coming from Wuhan, China and other countries with reported 2019 nCoV infections," PAGCOR said.

The nCoV has already killed more than 80 people in China and infected more than 2700.

Contamination of the virus has been reported in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan and has reached Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Australia, France and the US.
