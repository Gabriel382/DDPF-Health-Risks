The major averages are now 1.3% to 1.4% below their recent all-time intraday highs, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, SP 500 and the Nasdaq still have 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic readings above 90.00, which are patterns I call “inflating parabolic bubble” formations.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average set its all-time intraday high of 29,373.62 on January 17 still below its annual and semiannual risky levels at 29,964 and 30,361, respectively. Its quarterly value level is 27,432 with this week’s risky level at 29,290. A close this week below its five-week modified moving average at 28,590 will result in a technical downgrade.
The SP 500 set its all-time intraday high of 3,337.77 on January 22, above its semiannual pivot at $3,303.4 but still below its annual risky level at 3,466.3. Its quarterly value level is 3,103.0 with its weekly risky level at 3,347.2. A close this week below its five-week modified moving average at 3,230.4 will result in a technical downgrade.
The Nasdaq Composite set its all-time intraday high of 9,451.43 on January 24 just before the second coronavirus patient was disclosed in the U.S. This index is now between its semiannual and annual pivots at 9,074 and 9,352, respectively. Its quarterly value level lags at 8,860 with its weekly risky level at 9,455. A close this week below its five-week modified moving average at 9,015.45 will result in a technical downgrade.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average remains below its all-time intraday high of 11,623.58, which was set back on September 14, 2018. The quarterly value level is 10,349 with semiannual and annual risky levels at 12,155 and 12,755, respectively. This week’s pivot is $11,055. A close this week below its five-week modified moving average at 10,962 will result in a downgrade to negative. 
The Russell 2000 remains below its all-time intraday high of 1,742.09, which was set back on August 31, 2018. The quarterly value level is 1,616.55 with semiannual and annual risky levels at 1,831.90 and 1,910.58, respectively. This week’s risky level is 16,698.91. A close this week below its five-week modified moving average at 1,652.28. Its weekly slow stochastic reading declined to 86.11 last week down from 90.18 on January 17.
What’s interesting to note is that during the week ended January 17, Dow Transports and Russell 2000 were playing catch-up, as both set new 52-week highs then faded into the closes on January 17.
