Clorox gains after virus goes global 
 Clorox (CLX ) is higher on a down market day as investors bet the company will see increased sales of disinfectant wipes and other cleaning products amid the spread of the coronavirus in China and globally.

Clorox is due to report earnings next week, at which time management may update on if there is any extra demand due to the virus.
