Hong Kong in virus lockdown: it reminds me of the dark days of Sars 
 A day after Hong Kong confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus, the city’s leader Carrie Lam served dim sum at Davos.

It was part of a charm offensive to show the world’s elite that Hong Kong – despite months of pro-democracy protests and violent clashes – was still open for business.

But just as the political unrest showed signs of easing, Lam must confront a burgeoning public health crisis. The city has diagnosed eight positive cases as of January 27, and experts warn of a possible community outbreak.

The biggest fear is that the coronavirus would return the city to its darkest days: the 2003 Sars epidemic which killed nearly 300 of its residents.

Even after 17 years, the scars remain fresh. In the week leading up to Lunar New Year on January 25, each day saw more and more people wearing surgical face masks: on public transports, in crowded areas, at family gatherings.

Experts dispute whether masks can prevent the spread of viruses, but for the people of Hong Kong, it was muscle memory.
