Chinese officials confirmed Sunday that there had been more than 2,700 confirmed cases of the deadly pneumonia-like virus, including 461 people in a critical condition as the death toll rose to 80.

The virus, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, comes from a large family of coronaviruses, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It has spread beyond Wuhan to other major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Macao and Hong Kong.

The WHO has said that while the virus — which is spreading via human-to-human contact — is "an emergency in China," it has not yet become a global health emergency.
