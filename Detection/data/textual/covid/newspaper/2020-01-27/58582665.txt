Worries grow that quarantine in China not enough to stem increasingly virulent coronavirus: Even as the quarantine was being implemented, some 5 million people left Wuhan, the virus epicenter. 
 BEIJING — The effectiveness of an unprecedented quarantine around the viral epicenter in central China’s Hubei province has become a key question, as Chinese and international authorities ponder how to rein in the disease — and, at this point, whether it could be contained at all.

“Radical times call for radical measures,” said Dong-Yan Jin, a professor of molecular virology and oncology at Hong Kong University’s School of Biomedical Sciences. “A lot of cities have followed Wuhan in announcing a lockdown, but don’t forget that many potential patients are already out there before such an administrative order. Are we going to shut down the whole country?”

Jin said Chinese authorities had missed the critical moment to control the epidemic: before the New Year’s travel rush began a week ago.

“There was a lack of transparency in Hubei and an unwillingness by local governments to face the music; now, they tend to overcompensate,” he said. “You cannot expect that to work miracles and stop the outbreak.”

Widespread suspicions on Chinese social media that government officials mishandled the early stages of the crisis were fanned dramatically on Monday by an unlikely player: the Wuhan mayor. himself.

In a remarkable interview with Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, Zhou acknowledged that his city did not release “timely and satisfactory” information at the start of the epidemic, and he appeared to blame higher-ups in his chain of command.

“I hope everyone can understand that this is an infectious disease, and infectious diseases must be disclosed according to law,” he said. “We can only disclose information after we receive authorization.”
