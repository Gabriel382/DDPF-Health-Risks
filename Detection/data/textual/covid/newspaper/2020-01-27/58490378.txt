Introduction: Stocks, oil tumble on China virus fears


Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.

The year of the rat has not got off to a good start. Shares tumbled in the Asian markets that were open on Monday, as the death toll due to the coronavirus rose to at least 80 and the virus continued to spread. China extended its week-long lunar new year holiday by three days to 2 February and widened the restrictions that have curbed the movement of tens of millions of people.

The head of the World Health Organisation will hold a special meeting with officials in Beijing today to discuss how to contain the coronavirus, as more cases were confirmed outside China. About 400 people are critically ill and around 100,000 could already be infected around the world, experts are warning.


Japan’s Nikkei lost 2%, its biggest one-day fall in five months. Markets in China, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong were closed for the lunar new year holiday. A Tokyo-listed China proxy, the ChinaAMC CSI 300 index ETF, shed 2.2%.

European shares are expected to open more than 1% down, while safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, gold and US Treasury bonds are in demand. 

Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, slumped below $59 a barrel, and later traded at $59.38, down $1.3 or 2.2%. China is the world’s biggest oil importer.
