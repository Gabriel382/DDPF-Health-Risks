Asia Stocks Set for Further Losses on Virus Fears: Markets Wrap 
 (Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks looked set for further losses Tuesday as concern over the economic and human impact of China’s deadly coronavirus rattled global markets. Treasuries rallied and the yen held gains.

Futures pointed lower in Japan and Australia, which reopens alongside South Korea after a holiday Monday. Chinese and Hong Kong markets remain closed. The S&P 500 Index fell the most in almost four months with chipmakers, cruise lines and casino operators among the hardest hit as investors fled companies with close links to China. A gauge of U.S. equity volatility surged above its one-year average. The offshore yuan sank, breaching key technical levels.

Equity Pounding Feels Awful But Is Pretty Much Right on Schedule

Investor concern that China has failed to contain the pneumonia-like virus -- which has killed at least 80 people and infected more than 2,700 -- roiled markets at the start of a week jam-packed with corporate earnings. The outbreak shattered a calm in markets that hasn’t seen a 1% up-or-down move in the S&P 500 since early October.

“This is now a sell first, ask questions later situation,” said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. “Markets hate uncertainty, and the coronavirus is the ultimate uncertainty -- no one knows how badly it will impact the global economy. China is the biggest driver of global growth, so this couldn’t have started in a worse place.”

China’s financial markets will remain closed until next Monday after authorities extended the Lunar New Year break by three days as they grapple with the virus crisis.

Elsewhere, oil slipped to a more than three-month low, copper had its longest slump since 2014 and iron ore tumbled.
