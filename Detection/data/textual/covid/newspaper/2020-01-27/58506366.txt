Coronavirus 'already in UK' warns Public Health England medical chief 
 Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle has warned that there could already be cases of coronavirus in the UK.

Speaking to Sky News, she said that although she suspects the disease has already reached Britain, she insists the country is "well prepared" for an outbreak.

More than 50 people have now been tested for coronavirus in the UK, with all of the tests coming back negative.

Experts have warned that up to 100,000 people may already be infected by the disease which originated in Wuhan, southern China.

England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty has said there is a "fair chance" cases will emerge in Britain.

Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has joined calls for the UK to organise airlifts for UK citizens stranded in China.

He also warned of the pressure the coronavirus could put on the NHS.

Asked if he supported flying Brits back from Wuhan and elsewhere, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I think I would be very sympathetic and I'm sure the Foreign Office would be too."

He backed up Dr Doyle's claim that the NHS would be able to cope with a coronavirus outbreak, but added: "This is a very difficult time of year for the NHS."

Hunt went on: "I think the thing that will be difficult is the knock-on impact on other NHS services.

"I think it would be very, very challenging for the NHS in terms of the regular workload but I have absolutely no doubt that, when it comes to doing what comes to be necessary to isolate the virus and keep the public safe, our doctors and nurses will do exactly what they need to do."

A pair of British teachers who have been working in Wuhan have said they have been trapped in their apartment for five days.

Jason Neal and Sophie Hunt told BBC Breakfast all public transport in the city has been stopped and they are stuck in the city.

"All we keep hearing is that the death toll is accelerating every day," Sophie said.
