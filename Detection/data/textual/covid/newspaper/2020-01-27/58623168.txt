Gold futures mark highest settlement since April 2013 
 Gold futures on Monday marked their highest settlement in more than six years. Concerns surrounding the spread of the coronavirus fed risk-off sentiment, putting pressure on global stock markets and lifting haven demand for the precious metal. February gold GCG20, +0.29% rose $5.50, or nearly 0.4%, to settle at $1,577.40 an ounce. That was the highest most-active contract settlement since April 9, 2013, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
