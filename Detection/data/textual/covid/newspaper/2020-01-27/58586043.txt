  As China's coronavirus spreads, stocks tied to travel are taking  a hit. 
  Shares of airlines, hotels, and cruise lines all traded sharply  lower in early trading Monday as fears of a global outbreak of  the mysterious virus mount. The virus, which originated in Wuhan,  China, has so far   killed 80 people and infected more than 2,700 worldwide. It  has spread from China to multiple countries in Asia, the US,  Canada, France, and Australia. 
  Some airlines have let customers cancel or change flights with no  fee, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. A number of  companies have cancelled cruises that originate in China,  Cruise Industry News reported  Friday. In addition, travel agencies have been instructed to  stop booking group tours, a big driver of the Chinese cruise  industry, according to the report. 
  Global stocks and oil prices also slipped Monday morning as  traders react to the viruses rapid spread, which is reminiscent  of the SARS outbreak of 2003. Gold, long considered a safe haven  asset, rose Monday as investors look for protection from the  virus.
