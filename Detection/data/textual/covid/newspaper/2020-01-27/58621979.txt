Gatineau police investigate suspicious deaths in trailer park 
 Gatineau police are investigating suspicious deaths after a man and woman — believed to be husband and wife — were found dead at the Riviera trailer park.

The woman was found first inside the home, while the man was found dead in the backyard shed, where he ran a small-engine repair shop, fixing snowblowers and lawn mowers for neighbours.

Neighbours living across the street on Second Avenue said they heard nothing out of the ordinary Friday night or Saturday morning, when the bodies were found. Next-door neighbours on either side, and neighbours behind the tidy home said they also didn’t hear anything.

They described the couple as gentle and said they were saddened by the news that ricocheted through the neighbourhood. Some said authorities told them to stay inside their homes Saturday morning because close relatives were expected to visit the crime scene.

Police kept the home under guard Sunday while investigators sifted through evidence. Police also met with relatives and canvassed the neighbourhood.

Gatineau police declined to say what happened, but did not issue a public appeal for help in tracking any suspects.
