New Zealand sends samples to Australia to test for coronavirus infection 
 New Zealand has already sent samples away to Australia to test for infection of the deadly coronavirus.

The Ministry of Health confirmed that samples from two patients were sent across the Tasman to test for the first possible cases of coronavirus in New Zealand.

A spokeswoman said one of the tests had come back negative. As of Monday evening, results for the second were unknown, but had a "low index of suspicion".

New Zealand is sending possible coronavirus cases to Australia because no laboratory here is able to conduct the test. New Zealand-based testing is expected by the end of this week.

The new comes after Ministry officials said on Monday there was a "high likelihood" of coronavirus reaching New Zealand, with a moderate chance that it will be spread human to human when it arrives.

The new virus originated in the Chinese province of Wuhan in December and has rapidly spread to other countries, including Australia.

As of Monday night, 81 people have died, all of them in China, and nearly 3000 have been confirmed ill with the virus.

About 2000 people fly into New Zealand from China a day and public health officials have been checking all flights inbound at Auckland and Christchurch airport since Monday.

The Ministry is considering expanding that search to flights inbound from Australia.

Cabinet is expected to make the virus a notifiable disease on Tuesday afternoon, giving public health officials the power to quarantine people suspected of infection.
