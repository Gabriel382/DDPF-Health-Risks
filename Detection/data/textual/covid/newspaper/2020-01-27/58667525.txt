Countries evacuating nationals from China 
 Countries around the world are planning to evacuate diplomatic staff and private citizens from Chinese areas hit by the new coronavirus, which is spreading quickly.
Wuhan, a city of 11 million in the province of Hubei and the epicentre of the outbreak is in virtual lockdown and much of Hubei, home to nearly 60 million people, is under some kind of travel curb.
Following are some countries' evacuation plans, and how they are planning to manage the health risk from those who are returning.
* Germany will evacuate 90 citizens living in China's Wuhan region.
* Morocco will evacuate 100 citizens, mostly students, from the Wuhan area.
* France expects to repatriate up to a few hundred of its 800 citizens living in the Wuhan area. Evacuees will have to spend 14 days in quarantine to avoid spreading the virus in France.
