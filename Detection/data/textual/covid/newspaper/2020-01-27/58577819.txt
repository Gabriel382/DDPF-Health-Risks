Stocks sink as fears grow over coronavirus 
 U.S. stocks opened with heavy losses Monday amide fears that the coronavirus is spreading and could effect the economy.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 460 points after trading began Monday, falling 1.5 percent while the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite fell 1.5 percent and 2 percent each. Monday stock futures dropped sharply before the market opened at 9:30 a.m., implying a loss of more than 470 points for the Dow.

Stock market observers attributed the Monday morning dive to rising fear about the potential economic toll of the coronavirus, which originated in China. Nearly 3,000 people have contracted the virus, including five people in the U.S., and at least 80 have died, according to the New York Times.

“The Coronavirus is the number one threat to financial markets currently as global investors are becoming jittery on the uncertainty," said Nigel Green, chief executive of investment firm deVere Group, in a Monday research note.

“But whilst this health crisis will inevitably hit some sectors, such as travel and retail, most investors who have a properly diversified portfolio should avoid knee-jerk reactions. History teaches us that most issues of this kind have a short-term impact on stock markets.”
