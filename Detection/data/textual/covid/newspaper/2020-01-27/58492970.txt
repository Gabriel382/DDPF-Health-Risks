Australia 'very supportive' of health issues 
 New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard says if foreigners in New South Wales visit emergency departments they “will be treated for free” in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic. “Normally a foreign visitor, unless they have travel insurance, would be paying their costs if they came to one of our hospitals. That’s not the case,” he told Sky News. “In our country we are very supportive of health issues”. The death toll for the coronavirus is now at 80 globally. Image: Getty
