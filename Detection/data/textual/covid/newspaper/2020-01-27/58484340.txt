Coronavirus; Yogya Travel Agents Want Chinese Tourist 'Screened' 
 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Travel agents in Yogyakarta asked the government to implement strict health screenings and health check on tourists arriving from China and other countries that are likely to have been exposed to the coronavirus."The government must be resolute and hold them back from entering Yogya for the time being," business actor Edwin Ismedi Himna told Tempo on Sunday, January 26.Edwin said that screenings are necessary as the risks are high. Chinese tourists' visits, he said, will be able to enter the country easily once the outbreak is declared under control. Edwin said that he still receives information about Chinese tourists entering Indonesia, including Yogyakarta."There has been no cancellation of travel plans (from China to Indonesia), we are still waiting (for government's announcements) for the next two to three days," Edwin said.According to the Yogyakarta Tourism Office, in 2018 there were 19,197 Chinese tourists visiting the province—the sixth largest arrivals for that year.PRIBADI WICAKSONO
