CDC monitoring 110 possible coronavirus cases in 26 states 
 More than a hundred people across 26 states are being monitored for possible cases of the new coronavirus, health officials said Monday.

The number of possible cases of the dangerous virus nearly doubled to 110 cases over four days, up from the 63 previously reported to be under surveillance, according to CNBC.

“We understand that many people in the United States are worried about this virus and how it will affect Americans,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

“Every day we learn more, every day we assess to see if our guidance or our response can be improved.”

Five patients diagnosed with the virus in the US after traveling to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, officials said.

All of the patients are hospitalized and their close contacts are being monitored for symptoms.

“At this time in the U.S., this virus is not spreading in the community,” Messonnier said, according to ABC News. “For that reason we continue to believe that the immediate health risk from the new virus to the general public is low at this time.”

Meanwhile, the death toll from the virus has climbed to 82 in China and has reached over 2,800 cases, as local officials struggle to contain the epidemic, the Guardian reported.

The US State Department issued a new travel advisory Monday, urging people to “reconsider travel” to China out of growing concerns about the virus.
