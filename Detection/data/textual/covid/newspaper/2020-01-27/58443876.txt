Investors appear to be wary about the fast-spreading coronavirus, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

"Uncertainty continues to weigh on markets with increasing concerns about the deadly and contagious coronavirus, which continues to spread," Liz Kendall, senior economist at ANZ Research, wrote in a morning note.

More than 2,000 people, mostly in China, have been affected by the new respiratory illness and 56 are reported to have died from the disease.

The scale of the virus outbreak is already affecting the Chinese economy, according to preliminary data.

Markets in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan are closed for public holidays.
