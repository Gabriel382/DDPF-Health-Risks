Coronavirus declared to be of 'pandemic potential' as five Australians test positive 
 Health Minister Greg Hunt says there are people being tested for the deadly coronavirus in each Australian state and territory. Mr Hunt said five people have tested positive for the virus in Australia so far, with all five being treated in isolation and all are stable and well cared for. The health minister told Sky News the disease was declared to be of “pandemic potential” but Australian authorities were “moving at the fastest possible pace to make sure everything that can be done is being done”. “We have some of the strongest border protection measures in place around the world and we have biosecurity officials boarding all planes from China looking for symptoms,” he said.
