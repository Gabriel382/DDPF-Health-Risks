JPMorgan Says Short U.S. 30-Year Bond on Excess Haven Demand 
 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists are betting that the surge in demand for Treasuries thanks to fears about the deadly coronavirus will prove short-lived, sticking with a call to sell longer-dated bonds.

“This is the latest risk of a series that have driven U.S. Treasury yields far below what fundamentals indicate,” strategists including Matthew Jozoff wrote in a note Friday. “We don’t intend to be dismissive of the coronavirus, as it is a serious concern both in human and economic turns,” they wrote, while flagging that JPMorgan analysis notes a trend toward reduced mortality in health epidemics over time.

Geopolitical tensions stemming from Iran spurred a rally in Treasuries earlier this month, before the coronavirus emerged as a new threat to global economic growth. The bond bid extended on Monday, with 10-year U.S. yields sliding to the lowest since October.

That latest leg down came after JPMorgan strategists had calculated that yields were almost 30 basis points “too low” compared with expectations for growth, inflation and Federal Reserve policy decisions, along with gauges of investor positioning and the share of negative-yielding debt in developed markets.

“Ten-year Treasuries have not been this dislocated on this basis since a brief period in the spring of 2015,” JPMorgan calculated. “We remain short 30-year U.S. Treasuries.”
