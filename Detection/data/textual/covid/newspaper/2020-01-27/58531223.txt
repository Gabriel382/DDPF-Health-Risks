Pagcor orders 10-day quarantine on newly-hired, returning Pogo workers 
 MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) on Monday ordered all Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (Pogos) and services providers to impose a 10-day quarantine on all newly-hired and returning employees from countries with reported cases of the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.

“Recently, Pagcor issued a memorandum to all Pogos and services providers, ordering them to exercise extreme caution in selecting employees to be sent to the Philippines. Another order was issued today to impose a 10-day quarantine on all newly-hired and returning employees from countries with reported nCoV cases,” Pagcor said in a statement.

Pagcor added it supports the efforts of the Department of Health in strictly monitoring the entry of Chinese nationals being employed by several gaming firms in the county.

But even before the agency came out with these directives, it said some Pogo entities have already voluntarily avoided the entry of such workers in the country.

International media reported that 80 people have so far died and more than 2,700 have been confirmed infected in mainland China as the 2019-nCoV continues to spread in other countries.
