An unexpected death after a trip to China is "very unlikely" to be due to coronavirus.

A person not long back from travel died in Te Puke on Sunday, a statement from Toi Te Ora Public Health said.

"From the information we have, it is very unlikely that this person had the coronavirus," Dr Neil de Wet, Medical Officer of Health for Toi Te Ora Public Health, said.

"However, as the person had travelled recently to China, we have undertaken to rule out coronavirus as a possible cause, and also to provide reassurance to the family."

So far, there are no cases of novel coronavirus (or 2019-nCoV) in New Zealand, the statement said.

Anyone who returns from travel is getting information on it, and public health services will follow up any cases where coronavirus infection may be a possibility.

The aim is to identify anyone with infection early, so they can be isolated and people they interacted with followed up, to prevent the infection spreading.

Travellers who become sick within a month of their arrival are encouraged to seek medical advice and contact Healthline (for free) on 0800 611 116 or a doctor.

It is important to mention recent travel to China and any known contact with someone with severe respiratory illness who has been in China.
