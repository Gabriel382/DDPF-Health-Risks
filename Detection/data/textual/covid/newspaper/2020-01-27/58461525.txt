Jefferies has maintained underperform call and raised the target to Rs 199 from Rs 180 per share.

The Q3 group EBITDA missed our estimate, while net debt eased marginally QoQ, said Jefferies.

At 7x FY21e EBITDA, the risk-reward appears negative and rebound in steel prices should drive stronger margin in Q4, it added.

JPMorgan has maintained overweight call with a target at Rs 295 per share.

The research house broadly maintained its earnings estimates (-4% For FY21, +6% For FY22).

The key risk is China & how much of an impact coronavirus has on steel prices, it said.
