Nikkei hits 3-week low on rising coronavirus outbreak fears 
 TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Tokyo stocks sank Monday, with the benchmark Nikkei ending at a three-week low, as investors grew concerned that the spread of a new coronavirus originating in China could disrupt the global economy.

Investors fled to safe-haven assets such as the yen, whose appreciation against the U.S. dollar hit exporter issues. Airlines and retailers were hurt as China banned group overseas travel by its citizens for the Lunar New Year holiday in response to the outbreak of the virus.

The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average marked its biggest daily point drop in about 10 months, losing 483.67 points, or 2.03 percent, from Friday to 23,343.51, its lowest close since Jan. 8. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was down 27.87 points, or 1.61 percent, at 1,702.57.

The coronavirus outbreak intensified in Wuhan, in China's Hubei Province, with the death toll from the pneumonia-causing virus rising to at least 80. The Chinese government has confirmed more than 2,700 cases of the infection and warned that could rise.

With many Asian financial markets closed for the holiday, "investors focused on selling stocks in Tokyo due to uncertainty about how far the infection will spread," said Maki Sawada, vice president of the investment research and investor services department at Nomura Securities Co.

Many brokers said the market would be weighed down for a while by news headlines of the disease.

"The Nikkei will drop to around the 23,200 level if the outlook for the virus outbreak remains unclear," said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management Co.

Amid risk aversion, the dollar briefly dropped to around 108.70 yen in early morning trading, its lowest level in nearly three weeks.

On the First Section, declining issues outnumbered advancers 1,961 to 166, while 32 ended unchanged.

Tourism-related issues met selling amid fears that the spread of the virus could weigh on the number of tourists to Japan.

Travel agency H.I.S. tumbled 185 yen, or 6.8 percent, to 2,548 yen, while department store operator J. Front Retailing dropped 39 yen, or 2.8 percent, to 1,364 yen.

Cosmetics maker Shiseido, which has benefitted from spending sprees by Chinese travelers in recent times, sank 410 yen, or 5.5 percent, to 7,060 yen. Oriental Land, the operator of Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, plunged 1,225 yen, or 7.8 percent, to 14,500 yen.

With the virus outbreak causing a surge in demand for masks, textile and spinning companies received a boost. Fujibo Holdings advanced 335 yen, or 9.1 percent, to 4,020 yen while Shikibo jumped 167 yen, or 13.5 percent, to 1,407 yen.

On the Jasdaq market for small-capital issues, Shigematsu Works, a leading maker of safety and protection masks, rose by its daily limit, up 300 yen, or 20.7 percent, to 1,749 yen.

Trading volume on the main section rose to 1,180.46 million shares from Friday's 965.45 million shares.
