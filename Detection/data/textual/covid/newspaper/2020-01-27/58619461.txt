New York Braces for Coronavirus: ‘It’s Inevitable’ 
 “We are very clear: We wish New Yorkers a Happy Lunar New Year and we encourage people to spend time with their families and go about their celebration,” Dr. Barbot said.
In recent days, Lin Qiurong, 40, who emigrated from China’s Fujian province in 2002, had been weighing messages from friends, urging each other to avoid large crowds. But on Sunday, Ms. Lin and her three teenage children donned surgical face masks and ventured out to a Lunar New Year parade in Sunset Park, home to Brooklyn’s largest Chinatown.
It’s an event that the community looks forward to every year: Giggling children spray each other with canned silly string while lion dance troupes undulate and swerve to the beat of a pounding drum and clanging symbols. Traditional New Year’s music blasts from large speakers mounted atop a fleet of passenger vans.
There was still all that. Though as Ms. Lin walked down Eighth Avenue, ahead of the parade, she sized up the crowd, and could not shake the impression that there were fewer spectators lining up than in years past.
“Look around,” Ms. Lin said, speaking in Mandarin, noting that while there were plenty of vendors standing behind tables of confetti cannons and silly string, actual spectators seemed to be in short supply. “It’s much emptier compared to last year,” she said.
Louie Liu, 47, a member of neighborhood patrol group, Brooklyn Asian Cops, said he was not concerned about the virus — noting that it had not yet arrived to New York.
“I believe the Chinese government will be able to keep it under control,” said Mr. Liu, who emigrated from Fujian province in 1992. He added, also in Mandarin, that “New York State and New York City are also focused and prepared.”
