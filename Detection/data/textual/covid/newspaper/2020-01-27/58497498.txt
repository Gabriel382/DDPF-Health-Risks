About 50 Filipinos want to be repatriated from Wuhan 
 MANILA, Philippines — About 30 to 50 Filipinos would like to return to the Philippines from Wuhan, China where the novel coronavirus was first directed, Senator Christopher “Bong” Go said on Monday, citing information from the meeting of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of Health officials.

“Gusto nilang umuwi at handa naman po ang ating gobyerno na magdala ng eroplano kung saka-sakali sunduin sila dun sa China. Ang problema po kung papayag ang China,” Go said in an interview at the Senate.

The senator could not say however if those who want to be repatriated are working or just visiting Wuhan.

While the government is ready to repatriate the Filipinos in Wuhan, it will take necessary measures to ensure they   are free from the virus.

According to the Associated Press, the virus has already reportedly killed about 80 people in China, with 2,744 confirmed cases, as of Monday afternoon, since it first broke out in Wuhan in December last  year.

At present, the Chinese government is implementing a lockdown on several provinces, including Hubei, where  Wuhan city is located.
