Authorities 'pledged to crackdown' on deadly viruses decades ago 
 The Wall Street Journal China Bureau Chief Jonathan Cheng says authorities “pledged to crackdown” on viruses like SARS and make sure they weren’t “causing a problem to the human race”. “But here we are almost two decades later and we have a very similar problem on our hands,” he told Sky News. “SARS which happened in 2002-3 and related to this virus [coronavirus] also began in a very similar sort of market down in Southern China”. Mr Cheng added “it is hard to know” what is going to happen next. Image: Getty
