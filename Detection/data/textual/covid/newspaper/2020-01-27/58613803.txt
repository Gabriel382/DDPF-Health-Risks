CDC: no new confirmed cases of coronavirus 
 U.S. health officials on Monday said there have been no new confirmed cases of the Chinese coronavirus overnight, meaning there are still just five cases in this country.

The confirmed cases of coronavirus have been found in Southern California, Chicago, Arizona and Washington State.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they are investigating 110 people across 26 states who might have the coronavirus. Health officials have been saying for days they expect the number of U.S. cases to increase.

Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the risk for the United States remains low.

“At this time in the U.S., this virus is not spreading in the community,” Messonnier told reporters.

Messonnier said the CDC has screened roughly 2,400 people flying from Wuhan to five major U.S. airports and is considering expanding its screening and possibly changing its travel recommendations.

The CDC and State Department have advised travelers to avoid unnecessary trips to Wuhan, China, where the outbreak is believed to have originated. CDC has also recommended “enhanced precautions” for anyone traveling to China, including avoiding anyone who appears to be sick, and discussing travel to China with a health provider.

Chinese officials have locked down many cities in Hubei Province, including Wuhan, stopping any transportation in and out. The U.S. government is planning to evacuate citizens from Wuhan on Monday evening, with priority given to those who are most at risk from the coronavirus.
