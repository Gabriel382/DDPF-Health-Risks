ASX falls 1.7pc as China-exposed companies tumble 
 The Australian dollar and benchmark Australian bond yields fell sharply on Monday, dropping to multi-month lows as concerns about China’s coronavirus outbreak continued to build.
The Aussie dollar tumbled to 67.50 US cents, down close to 3 cents from the highs seen earlier this year and the lowest level since October 16. It currently trades at 67.60 US cents.
Australian bonds were also in high demand as risk aversion spread, pushing benchmark 10-year yields below 1 per cent for the first time since late November.
At 0.982 per cent, they currently sit at the lowest level since October 11, extending the drop since the beginning of the year to over 40 basis points. Given the absolute level of Australian yields, the move seen over the past month has been particularly large, and significant, as concerns about the outlook for economic growth and inflation intensify.
“What is becoming a little clearer is the Chinese economy will take a hit for a time,” said NAB economist David de Garis. “Travel and tourism is being impacted in China, in Asia and elsewhere, including in Australia where the Chinese inbound tourism market is the largest market in exports of personal tourism and education.”
