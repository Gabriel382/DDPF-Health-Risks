Some Filipinos seek repatriation from coronavirus-hit Wuhan: Go 
 MANILA -- Up to a third of the estimated 150 Filipinos in Wuhan have expressed desire to be repatriated from the Chinese city that is at the center of a novel coronavirus outbreak, the head of the Senate health committee said Monday.

The Philippines is ready to fetch the Filipinos from Wuhan by air, said Sen. Bong Go, also a former special assistant to President Rodrigo Duterte.

"Ako gusto ko rin makauwi na sila dito as long as talagang negative, talagang malinis at hindi affected ng virus pero nag-aantay tayo ng decision ng China," he said.

Go said the desire of some 30 to 50 Filipinos to be repatriated from Wuhan was discussed at a meeting of health and foreign affairs officials earlier Monday, which he attended.

China placed Wuhan on lockdown and a transport shutdown left millions stranded. Fifty-six people have so far died due to the novel coronavirus and some 2,000 were reported infected.

The Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai earlier said it was in contact with 150 Filipinos in Wuhan to ensure that those, "especially tourists or on short-time visits," will receive adequate aid during the lockdown.

At least 2 senators have filed resolutions urging the chamber to investigate the Philippines' preparedness against the new coronavirus strain, but Go said that he was not keen on scheduling the hearing anytime soon.

"Itâ€™s better to be vigilant at maging cautious tayo sa lahat pero wag natin takutin ang ating mga kababayan. Mahirap magpanic, mapaparalyze ang ating pamumuhay," he said.

As of Monday, the Department of Health is monitoring at least 11 individuals in the Philippines who may be potential carriers of the respiratory virus.

Four others, including a 5-year-old boy in Cebu City, tested negative for the pathogen.
