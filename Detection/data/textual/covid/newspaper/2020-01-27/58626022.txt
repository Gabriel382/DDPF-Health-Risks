CDC: 110 people in U.S. under investigation for Wuhan coronavirus 
 Roughly 110 people across 26 states are under investigation because they may have the Wuhan coronavirus, and officials are “imminently” considering updating federal travel recommendations, the CDC said today.

Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a call that officials are expected to soon announce travel recommendations amid the growing outbreak. As of Sunday, there are more than 2,000 confirmed cases worldwide — the majority in China — and 56 have been confirmed deaths. The CDC is advising against nonessential travel to Wuhan, and it recommends people traveling more broadly throughout China take enhanced precautions.

There are five confirmed U.S. cases so far — all in patients who had recently traveled from China. Messonnier said as of now, officials believe "the immediate risk to the general American public is low."
