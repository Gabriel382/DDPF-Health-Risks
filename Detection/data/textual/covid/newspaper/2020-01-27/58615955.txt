League of Legends delays major event due to coronavirus 
 China's premier League of Legends tournament postponed its second week of play due to the coronavirus outbreak. As the numbers of cases continue to rise, organizers are now concerned with the health risks of having crowds of people all in one place.

A tweet from the League of Legends Pro League (LPL) English Twitter account Monday said week 2 of its spring event has been postponed due to concerns over the coronavirus. The LPL is a 16-week league where the best teams in China play against each other in League of Legends, a popular multiplayer online battle arena game.
