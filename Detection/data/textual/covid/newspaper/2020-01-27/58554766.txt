Dow futures tumble 500 points as coronavirus spreads 
 New York (CNN Business) US stock futures dropped sharply Monday as concerns grew over the spread of a deadly coronavirus.

futures fell by as much as 500 points, or 1.6%.futures were down about 1.6% andfutures were lower by about 2.1%.

Eighty people have been killed by the coronavirus, according to Chinese health officials. There are more than 2,700 confirmed cases.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday confirmed a fifth case of the virus in the United States . Each of the infected people had recently traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

"As the human cost continues to rise, investors have become increasingly concerned about the potential economic consequences of the disease," said analysts at Dutch bank Rabobank.

Investors piled into safe haven assets, such as gold, which gained 0.9% to trade near $1,585 an ounce.

Meanwhile, oil prices fell by more than 3%. Futures for Brent crude, the global benchmark, were trading at $58.73 per barrel. US oil futures were down at $52.41 per barrel.

Goldman Sachs analysts said last week that the anticipated decline in regional travel could bring down jet fuel prices, causing crude oil to take a hit.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at Oanda, said that any moves today could be "exaggerated" because of the market closures in Asia. But he cautioned that the virus "will of course hang like a shadow over financial markets this week."

Halley also said that asset markets have been "pumped up" following the recent US-China trade deal and a slew of rate cuts by central banks last year. He said an unexpected shock to growth could leave markets "particularly vulnerable to a potentially strong downward correction."
