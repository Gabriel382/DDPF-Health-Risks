Universal Display -2.7% on potential coronavirus impact 
 Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini says the coronavirus could impact Universal Display's (NASDAQ:OLED) ability to ship key materials into Chinaâ€™s Wuhan, a major manufacturing hub.

A Wuhan travel ban went into effect last week and could also disrupt the operations at NAND company Yangtze Memory Technologies, which could provide a modest benefit to Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), says Hosseini.
