Govt 'keen to be seen' as leaders on coronavirus 
 Editor-at-large at The Australian Paul Kelly says Scott Morrison now has “an international, China based health challenge” in addition to “responding to the bushfires”. “We’ve just been through one challenge, the bushfires, and the interesting point was the government was slow on the uptake, its national leadership wasn’t there,” Mr Kelly told Sky News. “What we’ve now got with this virus is the government is very keen to get on the front foot and to be seen to be responding to this effectively”. The coronavirus death toll has risen to 80 globally. Image: News Corp Australia
