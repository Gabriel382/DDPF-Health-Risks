Muntinlupa City says no confirmed case of novel coronavirus 
 MANILA, Philippines — The Muntinlupa City government denied on Monday that there was a confirmed case of novel coronavirus in the city in contrast to unverified claims being spread on social media.

“Muntinlupa City Health Office [CHO] says that there is no confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in Muntinlupa to date. CHO urges the public to refrain from sharing unverified information on the 2019-nCoV,” the city government said in a tweet.

“The local government of Muntinlupa also calls on the public to be vigilant, practice proper hygiene, and adopt healthy lifestyles to boost immunity against infections,” it added.

This denial came on the same day that the Manila Health Department also said that there was no confirmed case of the virus at the Metropolitan Hospital in Binondo, amid a social media post claiming that a Chinese patient with suspected infection of the virus was admitted to the hospital.

While the Department of Health (DOH) emphasized the country remains free from nCoV, which has killed 56 in China and infected over 2,000 globally, at least 11 individuals have been placed under investigation for suspected infection of the mysterious virus.

According to DOH, the “patients under investigation” have been recorded from different hospitals in the country, particularly in Muntinlupa City, Pasay City, Kalibo in Aklan, Tacloban, El Nido in Palawan, Cebu City, and Camiguin.
