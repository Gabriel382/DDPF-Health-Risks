China-Batam Flights rarily Stopped amid Coronavirus Fears 
 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Flights from Shenzhen and Xian China to Batam's Hang Nadim Airport have been discontinued following the spread of the coronavirus. “Flights from China to here have been stopped by the travel agents there,” said Batam Mayor Muhammad Rudi after visiting the isolation room in Batam, Monday, January 27, 2020.Regarding the duration of the flight suspension, Rudi left it to the Chinese travel bureaus, as the policy to temporarily stop flights was the initiative of the travel bureaus as opposed to a request from the regional government.  “They stopped them, they will decide on it (when the flights will be continued). This means that they are also anticipating the (Chinese) people,” clarified Rudi. The last Batam-China flight will take off on Tuesday to bring the Chinese tourists back to their country.Prior to the suspension, direct flights from the two Chinese cities to Batam operated using aircraft chartered by a special travel agency, flying three times a week.The Riau Port Health Office (KKP) has enlisted the use of a thermal scanner to examine foreign tourists at Batam's Hang Nadim Airport suspected of being sick and infected by the deadly coronavirus. In addition, the KKP also required all officers at the airport, including immigration and customs officers, to continually wear masks as they are serving passengers from China who arrive in Batam.ANTARA
