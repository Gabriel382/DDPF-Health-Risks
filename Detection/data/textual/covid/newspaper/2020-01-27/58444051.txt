U.S. Stock Index Futures Slide as Virus Spread Saps Risk Demand 
 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock index futures slid in early Asian trading Monday as investors reacted to the spread of the deadly coronavirus over the weekend.

S&P 500 Index futures contracts expiring in March fell as much as 1.2% as of 8:35 a.m. in Tokyo, after China extended the Lunar New Year holiday for an unspecified period of time to help stem the spread of the coronavirus that has killed at least 56 people. Dow Jones Industrial Average contracts for March were down 0.9% while those on the Nasdaq 100 retreated 1.3%.

President Xi Jinping on Saturday ordered a faster response, sending teams into hard-hit areas to push local officials to strengthen prevention and containment.

“Risk profiles need to be adjusted as the Wuhan frenzy factor kicks in, and risk markets enter the fear zone, a highly pandemic place in its own right,” Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist at AxiTrader, wrote in note. “Even more so after President Xi calls the rapid spread of the virus a grave situation.”

A swathe of Asian markets are shut for holidays Monday including China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Australia. On Friday, U.S. shares posted their biggest drop since October amid reports of new infections around the globe.

“The biggest threat to the global economy is not just because the disease spreads quickly across countries through networks related to global travel,” Innes wrote. “But also, because any economic shock to China’s colossal industrial and consumption engines will spread rapidly to other countries through the increased trade and financial linkages associated with globalization.”
