China coronavirus outbreak: First case reported outside China - Is it deadly? 
 Coronaviruses can be more dangerous when they spread further down in the body to the lower respiratory tract.
When human coronaviruses spread to the lower tract, which includes the lungs, trachea and bronchi, they put more strain on the lungs.
Lower tract infections include bronchitis and pneumonia, which can be serious in some cases.
Coronaviruses spread differently to the cold or flu, highly contagious diseases which spread through the air via an “aerosol” mechanism.
Instead, they rely on close contact to infected fluids, including sweat and blood, meaning the disease has so far only spread within families.
