Authorities of China's Wuhan Admit New Coronavirus Can Transmit Human-to-Human 
 "Tests have not found any explicit evidence of the virus' human-to-human transmission at the moment. The possibility of human-to-human transmission is not ruled out but the riskÂ of human-to-human transmission is relatively low," the authorities said in a statement.

On Tuesday, Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the World Health Organization's emerging diseases unit, said that the virus could have limited human-to-human transmission but spread fast.

The unknown kind of viral pneumonia was reported from Wuhan in early January. The infected individuals reportedly display symptoms typical of pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases. It prompted fears on the Internet that the nation might be experiencing a return of the SARS, an epidemic that had claimed more than 600 lives in China throughout 2002-2003.

Last week, the epidemic was confirmed to be a new type of coronavirus. On Saturday, China confirmed the first lethal case in Wuhan.
