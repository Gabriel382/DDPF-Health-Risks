DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam told global elites in Davos on Thursday she is “cautiously confident” the city will get through the flu-like virus that threatens to inflict more pain on the protest-hit city.  
Lam’s statement to the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps comes as Hong Kong officials scramble to contain an outbreak of coronavirus that has killed 18 people in mainland China and forced authorities to lock down two cities. 
Hong Kong has already advised against any non-essential travel to Wuhan, a city of 11 million in mainland China and the epicenter of the outbreak.
