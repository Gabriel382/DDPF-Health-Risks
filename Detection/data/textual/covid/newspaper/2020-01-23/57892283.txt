Coronavirus vs Spanish flu: How deadly is China outbreak? Vs flu that killed 50 MILLION 
 The Chinese government has barred flights, trains and boats in and out Wuhan, with its population of 11 people urged not to leave unless absolutely necessary.
Other cities on lockdown include Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang.
Alongside travel prohibitions in Huanggang, the Chinese government has also shut down internet cafes, cinemas and other entertainment venues.
Officials fear the forthcoming Lunar New Year, which many Chinese citizens spend abroad, will only spread cases further afield.
