4 Chinese nationals exposed to new coronavirus before Manila arrival found: DOJ 
 MANILA - The immigration bureau has tracked down 4 Chinese nationals who were exposed to a person who had tested positive for the new coronavirus before traveling to Manila, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said Thursday.

The tourists flew to Manila from Hong Kong on Wednesday, authorities said, and are relatives of a Chinese man who tested positive for the new strain of the coronavirus after traveling from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began.

The immigration bureau is "monitoring their movements" and may refer them to the health department's Bureau of Quarantine, Guevarra said.

The Department of Health earlier said all passengers in the flight that carried the Chinese man's family did not show any symptoms.

"There was nobody exhibiting symptoms. There was no fever, no one showing upper respiratory tract infection so everybody was allowed to enter the country," DOH spokesman Enrique Domingo told ANC.

Domingo urged the public to consult a doctor if they have any history of travel to China, particularly to Wuhan, or exposure to people who have the illness as some patients may enter the country healthy and later show signs and symptoms.

The Philippines has started screening passengers arriving at the capital's main airport for fever and flu symptoms, after the new coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China and has claimed the lives of at least 17 people and sickened hundreds.
