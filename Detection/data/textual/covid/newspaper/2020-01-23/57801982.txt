 A Kerala nurse working at a hospital in Saudi Arabia is the first person from India to be diagnosed with coronavirus, which is prevalent in China and has killed 17 people so far.

He also informed that the nurse who tested positive for coronavirus is being treated at Aseer National Hospital in Saudi Arabia and recovering well.

Earlier, there were reports of a 45-year-old Indian school teacher from the Chinese city of Shenzhen being the first Indian to be infected with coronavirus. However, her husband confirmed that she is being treated for Streptococcal infection.

It was initially suspected to be a case of coronavirus.

Kerala Health Minister KK Shailaja on Thursday said that Gulf countries have informed India that Malayali nurses tested positive for coronavirus, however, no official number or confirmation has been received yet.

KK Shailaja said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has intervened in the issue, adding that the central government should too.

Through the Department of Non Resident Keralites Affairs (NORKA), we gave them the message to give them (nurses) proper attention there, the Kerala Health Minister said.
