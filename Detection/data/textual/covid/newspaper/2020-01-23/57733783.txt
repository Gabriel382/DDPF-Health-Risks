Manila to distribute 100,000 protective masks amid coronavirus scare 
 Manila city officials will distribute at least 100,000 protective masks to residents amid growing fears of coronavirus spreading throughout the country, the city's public information office said Thursday, acting on Mayor Isko Moreno's directive.

An outbreak of a new coronavirus that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has killed 17 and infected nearly 600 people globally.

Hong Kong authorities earlier said the family of a Chinese man who tested positive for the deadly novel coronavirus strain traveled to Manila on Wednesday.

Hong Kong Health Minister Sophia Chan confirmed that the patientâ€™s four family members flew from Hong Kong to Manila via Cebu Pacific 5J111, which landed at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport at 1:20 p.m.

The immigration bureau, meanwhile, has tracked down the Chinese nationals, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said earlier Thursday.
