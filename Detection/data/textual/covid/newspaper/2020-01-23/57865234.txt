Brazos County investigating suspected case of novel coronavirus 
 Brazos County’s health department is investigating a suspected case of the the mystery pneumonia-like virus that has claimed 18 lives in China and was confirmed in the U.S. for the first time earlier this week.

The department said in a tweet that the patient had traveled from Wuhan, China, the area where the so-called 2019 novel coronavirus originated.

Another departmental tweet said health-care providers in the area were aware of the public health guidance about the virus and quickly recognize the patient met the criteria for testing. The patient is being kept isolated at home.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which confirmed a case Monday, a man in his 30s under observation in Washington state, is currently screening travelers from China at airports in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York as part of early efforts to prevent the virus’ spread in the United States.

Houston’s George W. Bush Intercontinental Airport tweeted earlier this week that it did not see a need at this point for screening there.
