Chinese physician investigating new coronavirus may be infected 
 BEIJING (Kyodo) -- A Chinese physician, who investigated a new coronavirus in the central city of Wuhan, has been suspected to be infected by pneumonia, state-run media reported Wednesday.

Wang Guangfa, who has worked for a hospital of Peking University, was one of the members of an expert team that earlier this month visited Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak is believed to have originated, according to the media.

He is known as a leading expert on severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which emerged and raged in China in 2003 and then spread worldwide, killing 774 people. Wang has been in quarantine and receiving treatment, the media said.

In Wuhan, located around 1,000 kilometers south of Beijing, at least 15 medical professionals have been confirmed to be infected by the new coronavirus so far.
