Australian tourism experiencing 'a pretty tough time' 
 Sky News host Chris Kenny says Australian tourism is having “a pretty rough time” with the ongoing bushfire crisis, and now the coronavirus is making our “industry nervous”. Mr Kenny said the publicity of the bushfires are “scaring people away from holiday areas or out of the country altogether”, with reports suggesting damage to the industry “could soon top $6 billion dollars”. “This is an obvious and inevitable downside of some terrible bushfire disasters but clearly it has also been exacerbated by reckless exaggerations from climate activists and many in the media,” he said. “No wonder tens of millions of taxpayers’ dollars are now needing to be spent advertising at home and overseas that you can still holiday in the land down under. “If you get the chance, book a weekend away anywhere in the country and help out local communities.” Image: News Corp Australia
