Matilda Logarzo heads to English WSL 
 The 25-year-old midfielder's deal was announced on Thursday in the United Kingdom and Logarzo will link up with her teammates after she completes her current national team duties.

Logarzo is in camp with the Matildas ahead of Olympic qualifiers next month against China, Thailand and Taiwan.

The qualifiers were recently moved from the Chinese city of Wuhan due to deadly coronavirus outbreak, to Nanjing.

Logarzo, capped 41 times by Australia, had been playing with W-League champions Sydney FC.

She'll be linking up with Australian Tanya Oxtoby, who manages Bristol, in England.

City are struggling in this year's WSL, last on the 12-team ladder with just one win from 12 matches so far this season.

Oxtoby will be hoping Logarzo's experience will have an instant impact as her team tries to pull away from the relegation zone in the back half of the season.

As well as two stints in the National Women's Soccer League in the United States, Logarzo has previously played in Europe at Eskilstuna United in Sweden and Norway's Avaldsnes.

Logarzo's departure is another blow for the Sky Blues with striker Caitlin Foord announcing before going into Matildas camp she had played her last game for the club.

Foord is expected to join WSL leaders Arsenal, while superstar Sam Kerr is already at Chelsea and uncapped youngster Jacynta Galabadaarachchi is at West Ham.
