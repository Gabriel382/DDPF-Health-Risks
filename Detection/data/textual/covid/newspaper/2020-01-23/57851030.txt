Internet rips Justin Trudeau over choice of doughnuts: 'More unnecessary spending' 
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is under fire for his pastry choices.
"Picked up some of Winnipeg’s best to keep us going through another full day of Cabinet meetings. Thanks for the fuel, @OhDoughnuts," Trudeau shared along with a photo of him carrying seven boxes of doughnuts. 
Innocent enough, right? According to the internet, no. 
An assortment of 12 "regular doughnuts" costs $35 Canadian ($26.61 in US dollars), and assortments of 12 "specialty doughnuts" cost $47 Canadian ($35.73 USD), according to Oh Doughnuts' website. Many people on social media took offense to the high price point, accusing him of using taxpayer dollars for the sweet treats. 
"At $47 a dozen. I guess when you have unlimited taxpayer credit card, paying outrageous money for donuts is ok. Tim Hortons too low class for you," one person said on Twitter.
Others praised Trudeau for shopping locally. 
The local shop came to the prime minister's defense and explained its prices.
"Our pricing reflects our respect for our employees, the environment and our commitment to quality, local goods. We are a small biz that really appreciated the sale on a cold Jan Mon morn," the bakery wrote. 
For Trudeau's part, he's remained silent on the doughnut drama.
