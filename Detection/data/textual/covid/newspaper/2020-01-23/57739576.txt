Coronavirus: After Wuhan, China suspends public transport in Huanggang city 
 Hours after China suspended most public transport in Wuhan city, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, authorities in neighbouring Huanggang city also said it was imposing a similar lockdown. Authorities in Huanggang have announced to suspend its public bus and railway system beginning from the end of Thursday. They have also issued directions to shut indoor entertainment venues, including movie theatres and internet cafes in the city by the same deadline and urged citizens to not leave the city other than under special circumstances. Earlier today, most transport in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was suspended and people were told not to travel out of the city. Health officials fear the transmission rate will accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during week-long holidays for the Lunar New Year, which begins on Saturday.
