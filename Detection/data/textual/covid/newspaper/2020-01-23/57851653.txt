Apparel sector under pressure again 
 A weak earnings report from V.F. Corporation earlier today and renewed concerns about the global economy amid the coronavirus outbreak in China have sent a number of apparel stocks lower.

Some of the notable decliners are Canada Goose (GOOS ), G-III Apparel (GIII ), PVH (PVH ), Gap (GPS ), Nordstrom (JWN ), Ascena Retail (ASNA ), Chico's FAS (CHS ), Duluth Holdings (DLTH ), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF ) and Vince Holdings (VNCE ).
