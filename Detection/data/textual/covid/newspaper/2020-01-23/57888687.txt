 SINGAPORE (Kyodo) -- Singapore's health authorities on Thursday confirmed the first case in the city-state of pneumonia linked to an outbreak of a newly identified coronavirus strain in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

The case is a 66-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with his family on Monday, according to a press release by the Ministry of Health.

He is currently warded in an isolation room at Singapore General Hospital and his condition is stable.

The ministry said it has also been notified of a suspect case, whose preliminary test for the novel coronavirus is positive. She is a 53-year-old Chinese woman also from Wuhan.

The ministry said it was notified of this suspect case on Thursday, adding that the result of the confirmatory test is pending, and that her condition is stable.

Chinese authorities reported late Wednesday that 17 people have died from infections with Wuhan corona virus, all in Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the capital.

Singapore was one of the countries worst hit by the SARS virus during the 2002 to 2003 outbreak, with 238 people infected and 33 deaths.
