Aliyah Cardoza, who is from Azusa, was admitted to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles on Dec. 23 with flu-like symptoms and diagnosed with the coronavirus, as well as microplasma, pneumonia, and acute respiratory syndrome, news station KTLA reported.

“[She had a] fever and a cough. And it just escalated to where her fever was not breaking,” her mom, Gloria Aguilera, told the outlet.

Tests determined that the tot has the NL63 strain, which is not the same as the novel virus that originated in Wuhan, China, and has killed 17 people and sickened 600 more, according to the report.

“It is really relieving that she doesn’t have that strain,” Aguilera said.

Aliyah, who is expected to make a full recovery, has been incubated on breathing and chest tubes, the report said. While in the hospital, the tot’s lung collapsed and she suffered a seizure.

“I didn’t know she would end up in this kind of situation where I would have to see my child go through so much pain,” Aguilera said.

There are seven known strains of the coronavirus, which can cause symptoms of mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Wuhan coronavirus emerged last month in a central Chinese province and has spread to four other countries, including the US, where there was a case detected in Washington state.
