Shenzhen Commuters Checked for Fever as Coronavirus Spreads 
 Commuters had their body temperatures checked at a metro station in Shenzhen as Chinese health authorities seek to contain an outbreak of coronavirus that has killed 17 and affected over 500 people. Authorities conducted active case finding in all provinces by checking temperatures in public places and installing infrared monitors at major transport hubs. In a further attempt to curb the spread of the virus, the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated, has canceled its Lunar New Year celebrations, and tour agencies have been banned from taking groups outside the city limits, according to reports. The virus has been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and now the US, raising more concern among officials and citizens as China enters the busy New Year travel period.
