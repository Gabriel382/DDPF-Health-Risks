JetBlue stands out in airline sector 
 JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) is in early trading to stand in contrast to drops for peers across the airline sector.

Earnings reports from American Airlines (AAL ) and Southwest Airlines are in the mix, as well as some broad concerns over the impact of the coronavirus spreading out of China. Decliners includes United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL)  , Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK)  , Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE)  , SkyWest (NASDAQ:SKYW)   and Delta Air Line (NYSE:DAL)  .

JetBlue may be standing out today due to the dramatic cost-cutting drive initiated by management that is geared toward setting up the airline for budget-friendly airfares over the next decade as it ramps up capacity.
