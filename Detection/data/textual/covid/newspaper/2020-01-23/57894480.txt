Hear that ticking? That's Doomsday coming 
 Hate to break it to you, but humanity is doomed. That's at least according to a clock keeping track of how close the world is to catastrophe. Cool cool cool.

It's Ashley and everything's fine. Let’s dive into some news, shall we?

But first, tweet or it didn't happen: Trump set a record for sending the most tweets in a single day since he took office. Guess how many? (Answer at the bottom of "Real Quick")

Hide your kids, hide your wives: The world is 100 seconds to "midnight," according to the Doomsday Clock. That’s closer to destruction than at any point since the clock was created in 1947. The clock “conveys how close we are to destroying our civilization with dangerous technologies of our own making," according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a group that sets the clock. This year, the group moved the clock from two minutes to 100 seconds to midnight. The closer to midnight we are, the more danger we're in, the Bulletin said. "It is the closest to Doomsday we have ever been in the history of the Doomsday Clock,” said Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. 😯

During Harvey Weinstein's sex crimes trial, “Sopranos” actress Annabella Sciorra testified that the ex-movie mogul raped her in her New York apartment in 1993-94. The actress choked up as she described how Weinstein allegedly assaulted her and later told her in a "threatening" way not to tell anyone. "I was punching him, I was kicking him, I was trying to get him away from me," she said. Weinstein, 67, is charged with five sex crimes, including rape and sexual assault, stemming from encounters with two women. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has denied all nonconsensual sex.

Americans face little risk from the coronavirus spreading across China, according to health officials. The World Health Organization on Thursday declined to categorize the coronavirus as a global health emergency, saying there is no evidence of human-to-human infection outside China. Some airports in America aren't taking any chances: Officials in some cities stepped up health checks for passengers arriving from China. The coronavirus, which originated in the central city of Wuhan, China, has infected more than 540 and killed at least 17, according to Chinese authorities.

It could become more difficult for some pregnant women to get visas to visit the USA. The Trump administration issued visa guidelines Thursday in a move to curb "birth tourism" – trips to obtain citizenship for newborn children. Anyone born in the USA is considered a citizen (read: the good old U.S. Constitution). Under the new guidelines, which take effect Friday, visa applicants deemed to be traveling to the USA primarily to give birth will be treated like foreigners coming for medical treatment – they must prove they have the money to pay for the child. The guidelines could be problematic: Officers don’t have the right to ask if a woman is pregnant or intends to become so, so they would have to judge just by looking at her.
