Coronavirus in UK: Fears as four tested for deadly virus in Scottish hospital 
 The patients are being held in isolation at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital until medics have ruled out the virus. A statement from Scotland's Department of Health and Social Care said: "We have been carefully monitoring the situation in Wuhan for some time and are ready to put in place proportionate, precautionary measures.

"From today, enhanced monitoring will be in place from all direct flights from Wuhan to the UK.
"The enhanced monitoring package includes a number of measures that will help to provide advice to travellers if they feel unwell.
"For those travelling back directly from Wuhan, this includes a port health team who will meet each direct flight aircraft to provide advice and support to those that feel unwell."
Heathrow Airport has axed all flights from Wuhan following the deadly outbreak. There are normally three direct flights from the Chinese city to London every week.
