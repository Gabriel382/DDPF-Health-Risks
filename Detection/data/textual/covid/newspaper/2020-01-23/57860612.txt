Coronavirus outbreak: Chinese live animal markets a 'recipe for disaster' 
 Public health experts have warned that China’s live animal markets are a perfect breeding ground for emerging infectious diseases, with one expert branding them a “recipe for disaster”.

The source of the novel coronavirus, a new pneumonia-type illness which has infected nearly 600 people in China and killed 17, was a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

The animal source of the outbreak has not been identified but two recent research papers have pointed to bats and snakes as the possible culprits.

The market in Wuhan, now shut down, was home to stalls trading in many different animals, including snakes, marmots and poultry.

Purchasing food from these so-called “wet” markets is popular in China as consumers like to purchase their meat “warm” - that is, recently slaughtered.
