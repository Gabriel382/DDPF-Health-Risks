Dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus 
 The formation of a multi-ministry task force to tackle the Wuhan coronavirus reveals how seriously the country is taking its international spread. Temperature checks at Changi Airport have been expanded to cover all travellers flying in from China and not just Wuhan because the disease has spread rapidly beyond the city in Hubei province.

All public hospital emergency departments have been put on "outbreak response mode", with patients screened and those with fever and travel history isolated. Also, general practice doctors have been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any patients suspected of having the virus. The rapidity and inclusiveness of these measures attest to the urgency of being prepared collectively for an outbreak in Singapore.
