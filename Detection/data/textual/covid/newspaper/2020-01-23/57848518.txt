Coronavirus: health officials announce first known US case 
 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced the first known case of a new strain of coronavirus in the US. In a Tuesday press conference, a CDC spokesman said a US citizen returning from a trip to central China had been diagnosed in Seattle.

According to the CDC, the man is in his 30s and is in good condition at a hospital in Everett, Washington after returning to the area last week.

While in China, the man traveled to the Wuhan area, where the virus is believed to originate. It has since spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai.

The US is the fifth country to report a case of the illness. Nearly 300 cases have been reported in China, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. US authorities have begun screening air passengers coming from central China.

Last month, health officials began reporting new cases of viral pneumonia, including symptoms of fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Officials connected the patients to a food market in Wuhan.

So far there are six reported deaths, all in China. Most were 60 or older and had a previous medical condition. Although the virus likely originated from animal-to-people contact, Chinese officials this week confirmed their first case of person-to-person contraction.

CDC officials said the risk to the American public is low. According to Reuters, officials around the world have implement similar screenings to contain the virus ahead of the Lunar New Year travel season.
