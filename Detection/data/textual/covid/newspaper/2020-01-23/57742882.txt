The yellow metal had closed at Rs 40,660 per 10 gram on Wednesday.

However, silver prices fell Rs 95 to Rs 47,082 per kg from the previous close of Rs 47,177 per kg.

"Spot gold for 24 karat in Delhi was trading higher by Rs 63 with recovery in global gold prices and rupee depreciation," HDFC Securities Senior Analyst (Commodities) Tapan Patel said.

The rupee was trading around 8 paise weaker against the dollar during the day, he added.

In the international market, gold was trading at USD 1,556 per ounce, while silver was trading at USD 17.67 per ounce.
