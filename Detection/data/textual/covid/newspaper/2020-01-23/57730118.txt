BEIJING (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 23rd January, 2020) The Mass Transit Railway (MTR), one of Hong Kong's biggest public transport networks, stopped selling train tickets to the Chinese city of Wuhan, following an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus there, MTR said in a statement on Thursday.
"After negotiations with the Chinese railway authorities, it was decided that train tickets between Hong Kong and Wuhan will not be available until further notice," MTR said, adding that tickets would be refunded for passengers who had already bought them.
So far, there have been two confirmed cases of the deadly virus in Hong Kong ï¿½ one person came from Wuhan to the city, while another recently traveled to the virus-affected region. Chinese authorities have already issued a travel ban for Wuhan's residents.
According to the latest data, more than 570 cases of the disease have been confirmed in 25 Chinese provinces, and 17 people have died. In addition to Hong Kong, the virus has also been registered in the United States, Macau, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Japan.
