Go urges DOH to closely monitor Chinese arrivals for Lunar New Year 
 LUCENA CITY –– Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go urged the Department of Health and other concerned government agencies to closely monitor the influx of arriving Chinese from the mainland who want to celebrate their Lunar New Year in the country.

“The Chinese New Year is coming. A lot would come here so we should have close monitoring,” Go said in an interview here Thursday noon.

Being the chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Go said he was likewise closely monitoring the new coronavirus.

The Chinese will celebrate the start of Lunar New Year on Jan. 25.

The senator urged the public to follow safety measures and guidelines provided by the Department of Health to prevent contamination and further spread of viruses.

Go was the guest of honor during the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction, rehabilitation, and improvement of the Lucena Fishport complex in Barangay Dalahican.

The country is on high alert following the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus that has allegedly infected hundreds of people and killed at least nine in China.

The virus, which originated in Wuhan city in Hubei province late last year, has infected more than 440 people in China.
