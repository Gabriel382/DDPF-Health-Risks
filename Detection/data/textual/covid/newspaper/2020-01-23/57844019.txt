BEIJING (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 23rd January, 2020) The Chinese Finance Ministry said on Thursday it was allocating 1 billion Yuan ($145 million) to the province of Hubei for fighting the new coronavirus.
"An outbreak of pneumonia, stemming from the new type of coronavirus, has recently been registered in the city of Wuhan and other locations in Hubei province ... The situation remains tough, regarding prevention and disease spread control," the Finance Ministry said in a statement.
The ministry added it was allocating 1 billion yuan to assist prevention and disease spread control, following the direction by President Xi Jinping.
