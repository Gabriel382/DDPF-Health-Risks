Co-Diagnostics stock nearly triples after completion of design work for coronavirus screener 
 Shares of Co-Diagnostics Inc. CODX, -1.74% nearly tripled (up 177%) on heavy volume in premarket trading Thursday, after the molecular diagnostics company said it had completed principle design work for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening test for new coronavirus. Trading volume soared to 1.9 million shares, enough to make the stock the most actively traded before the open, and already more than 10-times the full-day average of about 161,000 shares. The company said its new test features its CoPrimer technology. "One of the most important advantages of our CoPrimer platform is its ability to reliably and accurately differentiate between similar genetic sequences, in order to reduce the likelihood of a false positive diagnosis," said Chief Executive Dwight Egan. "We believe that if the [World Health Organization] takes the step of declaring the illness a global health emergency following collection of more data in the days and weeks to come, Co-Diagnostics will be well positioned to quickly assist in providing these state of the art tools to affected countries." The stock has gained 9.7% over the past 12 months through Wednesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.03% has advanced 25.9%.
