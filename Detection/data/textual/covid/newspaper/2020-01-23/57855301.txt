U.K. testing multiple patients for deadly coronavirus as outbreak continues to spread 
 The deadly new virus that has sickened hundreds of people in China, several other Asian countries and the U.S. may have reached Europe for the first time. On Thursday, health officials in Scotland were testing five people for the infection while a man in Northern Ireland was being treated for symptoms associated with the pneumonia-like illness. The man had apparently traveled to Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, and has since been isolated at a hospital in Belfast, according to the BBC.The alarming development comes hours after a passenger who arrived at Los Angeles International Airport was taken to the hospital and quarantined after showing symptoms similar to the viral infection. American Airlines and state health officials have not released details about the person’s condition, but the airport said the passenger was hospitalized “for a precautionary evaluation.”The rapidly spreading outbreak has sickened more than 600 people in mainland China and neighboring territories and countries, including Japan, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. In addition, 17 patients have died in and around Wuhan since the virus was first detected last month. Only one case has been confirmed in the U.S. so far. A Washington State man who recently traveled to China has been isolated at a Seattle-area hospital, but he’s expected to recover, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
