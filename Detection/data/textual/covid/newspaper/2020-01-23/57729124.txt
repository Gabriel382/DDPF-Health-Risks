2 airlines to suspend Wuhan flights from Kalibo after novel coronavirus scare 
 MANILA, Philippines – At least two airlines have declared flight suspensions from the Kalibo International Airport to Wuhan in China after a novel coronavirus strain has killed at least 17.

In a letter to Kalibo International Airport officer-in-charge Engr. Eusebio Monserate Jr. on Thursday, Pan Pacific Airlines Kalibo station head Timothy Jones Cabrera said the airline is suspending flights to Wuhan starting January 25.

This came after Wuhan also suspended outbound flights and train operations to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has already affected 400 individuals.

Pan Pacific said that they were allowed by Wuhan’s Airport Authority to deploy two remaining inbound flights to Wuhan on Thursday night and on Saturday, “to ferry remaining passengers still in Boracay”.

However, the airline clarified that the return flights will not be carrying any passengers.

Earlier, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) Director General Jim Sydiongco said  Royal Air, another airline that provides direct flights between Kalibo in Aklan to Wuhan, has suspended flights until the health issue has been contained.

A new strain of the coronavirus, often compared to the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), was reported to be spreading in Wuhan, forcing the Wuhan local government to advise people against traveling to their city.
