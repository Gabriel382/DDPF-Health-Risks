What We Know About the Wuhan Coronavirus 
 The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed 198 confirmed cases in Wuhan. Researchers found that 22 percent had direct exposure to the meat market, and 32 percent had contact with people who had a fever or respiratory disease. But roughly half had neither been to the market nor had contact with anyone who was sick.
Of the 198 infected, 25 have recovered, three have died and 170 are still being treated. Of the 170 being treated, 126 were described as having mild disease, 35 with severe disease and nine were said to be in critical condition. Sixteen health care workers were infected while caring for patients, the report said.
How dangerous is it?
Health officials around the world are alarmed, but it’s hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus.
“When we get a new infectious disease, we learn about the most severe cases first, the top of the pyramid, as it were,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “As the investigation goes on, we often learn there are less severely infected people, and even people who are infected who don’t get sick at all.”
By comparison, roughly 200,000 people are hospitalized with the flu each year in the United States, and about 35,000 people die.
But while some scientists say the virus appears to be less severe than other coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, it is not clear whether Chinese authorities have been fully transparent about the number of infections or the number of deaths, or even whether these figures are being carefully tracked.
“The information we know is changing rapidly,” said Dr. Vaishampayan, of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “Whenever a new virus comes out, it takes a while to learn about it. There are going to be a lot of changes.”
