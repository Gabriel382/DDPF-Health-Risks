Britain says death toll from new coronavirus in China likely to rise 
 LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Britain's health minister said on Thursday that the number of cases of new coronavirus is likely to be higher than confirmed so far so the death toll will probably rise further.

"All the fatalities have so far been contained to mainland China, however, this is a rapidly developing situation and the number of deaths and the number of cases is likely to be higher than those that have been confirmed so far and I expect them to rise further," Health Secretary Matt Hancock told parliament.
