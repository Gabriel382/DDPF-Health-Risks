NHS doctor claims coronavirus is 'negative karma' for not being vegan 
 An NHS GP has claimed the deadly Coronavirus outbreak is karma for not being vegan.

Dr Ameera Brett – who boasts online about pushing vegan lifestyles on patients – said the outbreak was "negative karma" for the "horrendous way we treat our animals".

The 41-year-old is a practising medic at the £2million Mountain View Health Centre in Swansea, Wales.

She wrote on Twitter last night: "This new coronavirus has occurred because of the horrendous way we treat our animals.

"This is another negative karma after the environmental destruction and our bodies being ravaged by cancer, strokes, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.

"These devastating illnesses that are strongly linked with consuming meat, dairy and eggs.

"The conditions these animals are living through are absolutely horrendous, extremely filthy sheds, often no food or water, animals are so stressed and starving they start cannibalising each other.

"This has to end now or worse to come – we are doing something that is wrong and against nature, the order and sanctity of life."

Dr Brett runs the @YourVeganDr Twitter account – which equates "speciesism" with racism and sexism.

Earlier this month she told a Twitter user: "I am a GP and I recommend it [veganism] to my patients."

And in September she said: "If our patients are encouraged to follow a vegan diet watch obesity levels, heart attacks, strokes and diabetes crumble down."

At least 25 people are confirmed to have died from the ultra-contagious coronavirus.

China has confirmed over 500 cases of the disease and has put Wuhan into lockdown as the virus continues to spread.

Actual figures are likely to be much higher, with leading Virologists suggesting billions could be at risk.

The SARS-like virus has seen cases confirmed in China, Japan, Korea and the US.
