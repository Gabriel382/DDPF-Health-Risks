Coronavirus: three Chinese cities in lockdown in attempt to contain virus 
 Three Chinese cities accounting for an area of 20 million people have been put on lockdown in an attempt to contain a deadly virus.

On Thursday, authorities banned transport links from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, as well as the nearby central Chinese cities of Huanggang and Ezhou, suspending buses, subways, ferries and shutting the airport and train stations to outgoing passengers.

The blockade comes as at least 633 people have been infected with the coronavirus, from the same family of viruses that gave rise to Sars. Officials worry the upcoming lunar new year holiday, when hundreds of millions of Chinese will criss-cross the country, will exacerbate an outbreak that has reached almost all of the country’s provinces, as well as the US, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Macau and Hong Kong.

Chinese authorities said on Thursday that 95 patients were in critical condition. So far, 17 people have died since the virus was detected in late December, all of them in Wuhan.

In Wuhan, supermarket shelves were empty and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and isolated themselves at home. Petrol stations were overwhelmed as drivers stocked up on fuel, exacerbated by rumours that reserves had run out. Local residents said pharmacies had sold out of face masks.

“When I saw the news when I woke up, I felt like I was going to go crazy. This is a little too late now. The government’s measures are not enough,” said Xiao, 26, a primary school teacher in Wuhan, who asked not to give her full name.

Few pedestrians were out and families cancelled plans to get together for the lunar new year holiday. Special police forces were seen patrolling railway stations. Residents and all government workers are now required to wear face masks while in public spaces. Most outbound flights from Wuhan’s Tianhe airport were cancelled.
