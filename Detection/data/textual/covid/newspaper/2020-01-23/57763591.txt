Coronavirus lockdown: Ezhou sealed off by panicked officials as outbreak spreads 
 People living in Ezhou have been quarantined in a bid to contain the virus which has infected more than 630 people and spread beyond the country's borders. The lockdown comes after residents in the cities of Wuhan and Huanggang were ordered not to leave and public transport was brought to a halt. Officials fear the spread of the mysterious virus will be accelerated when hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to this weeek travel home for the Lunar New Year.

Ezhou, a city of one million people, lies 55 miles east of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected. 
Authorities in Ezhou said all train stations had been shuttered. 
Ezhou is located just 18 miles from Huanggang, across the Yangtze River. 
It brings the number of people on lockdown to 20 million. 

Huanggang health authorities in the city of around 7.5 million said they would suspend public bus and railway operations from midnight (4pm UK time).
They also ordered indoor entertainment venues including movie theatres and internet cafes to shut, and asked citizens not to leave the city other than under special circumstances.
Huanggang had reported 12 cases of the coronavirus as of the end of Monday.
All flights out of Wuhan have been suspended and urban transport networks have been shut. 
Of eight known cases of the virus outside of China, Thailand has confirmed four, while Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the US have reported one each.
