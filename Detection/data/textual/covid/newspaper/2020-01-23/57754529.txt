Huawei, BRI Speak Up on Suspected Coronavirus Case at BRI II 
 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Huawei Indonesia Public Relations Manager, Mohamad Ilham Pratama, gave clarification regarding the previous report on a suspected coronavirus case of one of its employees in Jakarta’s BRI II building earlier today.“As of now, we are unable to confirm whether the employee is infected by the coronavirus or not. [At least] until we receive official confirmation from medical authorities at the hospital. We will follow it up after we have received official confirmation,” said Ilham in a text message to Tempo on Thursday, January 23. At the same time, Ilham Pratama confirmed that face masks were distributed in the BRI II building as a standard health security measure within the office confines. Meanwhile, Corporate Secretary PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) Hari Purnomo also said that they continue to coordinate with Huawei Tech Investment to investigate whether the coronavirus case is, in fact, true. “The Huawei employee with the fever has been taken to a nearby hospital to receive medical treatment and to conduct a diagnosis confirming the validity of news regarding the coronavirus case,” said Hari in a written statement on Thursday. Previously reported, an employee of the Huawei Tech Investment headquarters at Jakarta’s BRI II Building located in Bendungan Hilir is reportedly being isolated over a suspected coronavirus case. Based on the information Tempo obtained, the employee had just returned from a trip to China. This was corroborated in a text message from an employee working in the same building.“Yes. I heard that it is [being isolated] and still under investigation. No one is allowed to exit the building currently and [we] are told to stay put in each respective office compartments,” said the worker at the BRI II building who requested to remain anonymous. JULNIS FIRMANSYAH
