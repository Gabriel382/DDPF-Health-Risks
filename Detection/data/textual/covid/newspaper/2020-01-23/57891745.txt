Turnaround Thursday in more ways that one

US stocks managed to retrace early losses to close mixed. Having shed as much as 0.6 per cent at the open, the SP 500 reclaimed its losses throughout the session, supported by the World Health Organisation’s avoidance of declaring the Coronavirus outbreak an international public health emergency. Tech stocks were once again the outperformers on Wall Street.
Oil prices were hammered. Again. WTI Crude prices fell in excess of 2 per cent as traders continued to fret that the coronavirus will severely crimp global travel, and therefore energy demand. The weakness in the oil price came despite the release of US crude inventory data which revealed a greater-than-expected draw last week.
The SP/ASX 200 is set for a gain of 21 points this morning, according to SPI Futures. The move will reclaim a small fraction of the benchmark index’s losses yesterday. The benchmark dropped over 0.6 per cent, largely due to the concern surrounding coronavirus, along with the release of better-than-expected local jobs data. The materials and industrials sector led the losses as traders pondered the potential impacts on growth from the coronavirus.
