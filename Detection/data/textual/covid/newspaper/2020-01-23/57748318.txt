Two more Chinese cities quarantined over coronavirus: WSJ 
 Authorities in China have locked down more cities as they try to come to grips with the coronavirus outbreak that has now spread beyond the country's borders. After Wuhan, believed to be the epicenter of the outbreak, was quarantined with travel in and out of its borders banned, Huanggang has cut off buses and long-distance trains and will close its public transportation system as of midnight on Friday, local time, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The city of 7.5 million people is 35 miles east of Wuhan. Neighboring Ezhou said it would impose similar restrictions. To date, the virus has killed 17 people and infected hundreds and is hampering travel in the country as the Lunar New Year holiday begins this weekend. The U.S., Japan, South Korea and Thailand have all reported cases of coronavirus.
