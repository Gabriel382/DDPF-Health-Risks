Coronavirus: Nicola Sturgeon's statement in full 
 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish Government is "closely monitoring" a virus which has spread from China.

She was asked at FMQs by SNP MSP Kenneth Gibson about the steps being taken to ensure the safety of Scots after the disease killed 17 people and infected nearly 600.

It is believed the disease, known as coronavirus, emanated from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has an international airport connecting to 60 destinations across the world.

"I should say, that the risk to the public here in Scotland - and indeed the UK - is currently classified as low but that is kept under review.

"Health Protection Scotland are liaising with NHS boards and are currently in daily contact with Public Health England, we're also liaising daily with colleagues in the UK Department of Health - we're also paying very close attention to the advice and the decisions that come from the World Health Organisation."

"We're currently considering whether there is any further information that could be provided at Scottish airports.

"This is an evolving situation which we will monitor extremely closely and the Health Secretary and I will make sure that Parliament is updated in the days and weeks to come."

The Chinese Government has effectively "locked down" Wuhan, with planes and trains being cancelled, along with the nearby city of Huanggang.
