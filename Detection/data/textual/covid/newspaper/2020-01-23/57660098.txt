WHO holds off declaring global outbreak of Wuhan coronavirus 
 VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) — After holding an emergency meeting, the World Health Organization holds off declaring a global outbreak of Wuhan coronavirus.

WHO says it is split on the decision and needs more information before making recommendations on how best to handle the virus — specifically in China where the virus originated.

Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus, the organization’s director, described the decision as serious.

“Today there was an excellent discussion during the committee meeting, but it was also clear to proceed we need more information. For that reason, I have decided to ask the emergency committee to meet tomorrow.”



 Meantime, Chinese state media reported the city of Wuhan is shutting down outbound flights and trains to battle the spread of the new virus.

The current death toll for Wuhan coronavirus is 17 people while hundreds more are sick.

As for the risk of the virus coming to British Columbia, the Provincial Health Officer says it wouldn’t be a surprise, but insists the province’s health care system is prepared.

“As long as we’re aware of it, people are open about it, they tell their health care provider about travel, and then we know that we have the resources in place to safely assess and care for people,” Dr. Bonnie Henry says.

Health leaders will meet again Thursday to further discuss the situation.
