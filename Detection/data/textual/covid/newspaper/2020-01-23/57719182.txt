(Reuters) - London’s main index dipped for a fourth straight session on Thursday, with major miners and oil stocks taking a hit, as worries over the spread a new flu-like virus from China grew. 
China put Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, on lockdown as health authorities around the world scramble to prevent a global pandemic. The new coronavirus has so far killed 17 and infected nearly 600 people. 
The FTSE 100 .FTSE, which has shed more than 1% this week, gave up another 0.2%. An index of miners .FTNMX1770 hit its lowest in more than a week, while Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) were among the biggest drags. 
The FTSE 250 .FTMC edged 0.1% lower by 0807 GMT. 
However, AIM-listed online fashion retailer ASOS (ASOS.L) provided some cheer as it advanced almost 9% after beating analysts’ expectations for sales growth in the Christmas trading period.
