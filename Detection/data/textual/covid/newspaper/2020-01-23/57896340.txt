Person quarantined in Sydney hospital for testing over suspected case of coronavirus 
 A person in Sydney has been quarantined in hospital after being suspected of contracting the deadly coronavirus. 
The person was yesterday placed into quarantine in an unnamed hospital. Tests today will confirm whether or not the person has contracted the deadly virus, a NSW Health spokesperson told news.com.au.
The individual, whose identity, age, and gender also have not been revealed, was not on a flight from Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the virus, that arrived in Sydney yesterday. It’s not clear if they arrived in Sydney on a previous flight or had been living locally before becoming unwell. As the flight touched down yesterday, passengers and crew wore face masks, and those who flagged concerns about their health had their temperature taken.
The man responsible for Australia’s borders has defended the national response to the coronavirus.
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has been questioned about whether Australia is doing enough to guard against a potential pandemic of the deadly disease.
“We have the world’s best protocols in place,” Mr Dutton told the Nine Network on Friday.
“I think people should recognise that in a country like ours, the health services are the best prepared, best able to respond, and they can quarantine people very quickly.”
Doctors and nurses experienced in infection control were at the airport working alongside the Australian Border Force. Virology experts were also there.
No unwell passengers were found on the flight. However, those exposed to the virus may not display flu-like symptoms for up to a week.
Crossbench senator Rex Patrick questioned why only flights from Wuhan were being screened by biosecurity staff.
“More than 40 direct China flights will arrive in Australia today,” Senator Patrick said on Friday.
“Why aren’t all direct flights being screened?”
