Special screening rolled out for Chinese tourists in Dubai 
 Special screening is being rolled out for Chinese tourists in Dubai ahead of the Lunar New Year to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that has been causing havoc across the globe.

Passengers from direct flights to Dubai International Airport and Abu Dhabi International Airports in the United Arab Emirates will receive thermal screening, Reuters and The Associated Press reported. The announcement was made as the coronavirus that seemingly started in Wuhan has now killed 17 people as there are almost 600 confirmed cases in the country.

The Dubai Health Authority and the Airport Medical Center will conduct the screenings at secured gates at Dubai International Airport, according to a statement from the airport obtained by the AP.

The airports are bracing for a typically busy 40-day period, but officials at Dubai’s airport would not say if they expect a decrease in Chinese travelers due to the virus. Dubai’s airport is the third busiest in the world, and more than 3.6 million Chinese travelers passed through the airport in 2019, the airport posted.

China has shut down transportation in Wuhan after concerns of the virus spreading from human-to-human contact. Two other cities, Huanggang and Ezhou, were shut down, including theaters, internet cafes and other entertainment areas in Huanggang.
