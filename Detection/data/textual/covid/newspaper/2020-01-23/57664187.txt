Q&A: Why Chinese outbreak sparked global concern 
 Why is the coronavirus causing global concern? Most of the large family of coronaviruses, which originate in animals, are mild. They are associated with the common cold. But some can be severe and deadly. Several people have died after contracting this new virus, which may have jumped from bats to humans. Where is it circulating? The virus first began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Japan, Thailand and South Korea have reported cases and now a man in his 30s in Washington state, USA, has tested positive. How is it spread? Coughs and sneezes. Touching or shaking hands with an infected person can pass it on, as can contact with a surface or object. What are the symptoms? Fever, fatigue, sore throat and dry cough in the early stages of the disease. As the illness progresses, patients may experience difficulty breathing. Coronaviruses and flu viruses have similar symptoms, but genetically they are very different. Flu viruses incubate very rapidly - you tend to get symptoms two to three days after being infected, but coronaviruses take much longer. Is there a test for it? The virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China to enable other countries to quickly diagnose potential new cases. How is it treated? There is no specific treatment. Plenty of fluids, rest and sleep. What is being done to halt the spread? Countries have stepped up airport surveillance screening people for high temperatures. Emergency departments are asking patients about their recent travel history.
