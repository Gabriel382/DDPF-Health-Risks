Asia stocks fall as coronavirus death toll rises in China 
 Stocks in Asia declined in Thursday morning trade as the death toll rises in China due to a mysterious pneumonia-like virus.

The Nikkei 225 in Japan slipped 0.75% in early trade while the Topix index also shed 0.54%.

Japanese trade data released Thursday showed exports falling more than expected in December. Japanese exports for December fell 6.3% in December as compared to a year before, data from country's Ministry of Finance data showed. That was far lower than expectations of a 4.2% decrease expected by economists in a Reuters poll.

South Korea's Kospi also saw losses as it declined 0.52%.

Meanwhile, shares in Australia declined in morning trade, with the S&P/ASX 200 falling about 0.3%. Investors will await the release of employment data in the country for December, set to be out at about 8:30 a.m. HK/SIN.

Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index traded around 0.1% lower.

Investor sentiment has taken a hit this week as the mysterious coronavirus that has infected hundreds in China spreads. The World Health Organization postponed a decision Wednesday over whether to declare the disease a global health emergency.
