Tell us: have you been affected by the coronavirus? 
 According to the head of infection medicine at the University of Edinburgh, four people in Scotland are being tested for coronavirus after returning from Wuhan.

Speaking to the Guardian’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, Prof Jürgen Haas said: “The situation will be pretty similar in pretty much all UK cities with a large number of Chinese students. It’s not too surprising. My suspicion is that there will probably be many more cases in many other cities in the UK.”
