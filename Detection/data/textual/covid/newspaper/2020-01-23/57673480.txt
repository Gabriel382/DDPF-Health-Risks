WESG APAC CS:GO Finals Cancelled Due to Wuhan Virus 
 FFollowing the outbreak of the Wuhan Virus, the World Electronic Sports Games (WESG) has issued a statement announcing the cancellation of the CS:GO Asia Pacific (APAC) Finals.

This comes after Chinese authorities advised people to avoid travelling to Wuhan as the death toll from the outbreak of the coronavirus rose to 17 on Wednesday. The tournament was initially scheduled to take place in Macau from February 16 until 18.

Over 500 people in China have been infected so far, including one confirmed case in Macau.

The WESG APAC CS:GO Finals event was supposed to be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in January but due to the organisers' failure to secure the resources required to run the tournament, the entire event was postponed to February and moved to Macau.

Currently, no replacement dates have been released by the organizers just yet but it is likely that weâ€™ll hear from them again after the Lunar New Year festivities. Sixteen teams from around the world have been affected by this announcement.
