SHANGHAI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Shanghai steel futures hit one-month lows on Thursday ahead of a week-long Lunar New Year break on worries that a new coronavirus outbreak in the country would hit construction activity.

The Shanghai Futures Exchange's most-traded steel rebar contract SRBcv1 closed down 1% to 3,500 yuan ($506.95) per tonne on Thursday after hitting its lowest level since Dec. 26 earlier in session.

Shanghai's hot-rolled steel coil SHHCcv1 , used in cars and home appliances, also hit a one-month low on Thursday, closing 0.8% lower at 3,521 yuan.

"The spreading coronavirus in China is raising concerns that the busy construction period following the Lunar New Year will be delayed," ANZ Research wrote in a note, as China's construction season tends to start after holidays.

"Construction activity has been positive for the steel and iron ore sector. However, any disruption at this peak time could rattle the fragile recovery that emerged in December," it added.

China has confirmed 571 total cases and 17 deaths stemming from the outbreak of the coronavirus, which is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. benchmark iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange DCIOcv1 with May expiry also dropped on Thursday, falling 2.3% on Thursday to close at 649.5 yuan per tonne.

Spot prices of the benchmark 62% iron-content ore, as tracked by SteelHome consultancy SH-CCN-IRNOR62 , fell by $0.4 to $96.8 per tonne on Wednesday.

China's markets will be closed for a week from Friday for Lunar New Year holiday.
