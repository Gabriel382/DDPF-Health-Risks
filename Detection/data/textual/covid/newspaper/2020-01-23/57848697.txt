5 ETFs From Top Industries That Won't Let You Down in 2020 
 Right from the beginning of 2020, global events have been pulling the strings of the investing world. While negative stories included Middle East tensions and outbreak of Coronavirus, the signing of the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was a positive one. The broader market remained a bit volatile, having reacted to such issues. The S&P 500 has gained about 2% so far this year, after a stellar 2019.

The road ahead from here would be mixed with the uncertainty regarding the U.S. presidential election, the fate of Brexit, and the level of execution of the U.S.-China trade deal. Global growth momentum is also showing signs of slowdown, though worldwide monetary policy easing should continue to support the stock market (read: Global Policy Easing Cycle Set in Motion: ETFs to Win).
