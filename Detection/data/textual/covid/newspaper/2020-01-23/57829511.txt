CAIRO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Egypt started screening passengers arriving from China for signs of the new coronavirus outbreak at all entry points into the country, the health ministry and airport sources said on Thursday. 
“All travelers arriving from areas where the disease appeared are screened and any suspected cases are immediately isolated,” a health ministry statement said.
