Beijing Confirms Cancellation of Chinese New Year Celebrations Amid Coronavirus Outbreak - Reports 
 Beijing's Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism has decided to cancel large-scale events, including temple fairs, starting this Thursday in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Chinese media reported this Thursday.

At the same time, the administration of the Forbidden City - a complex that houses the Palace museum in central Beijing, has stated that it will be closed starting today.

In late December, an outbreak of previously unknown pneumonia, later identified as a new strain of coronavirus, was registered in the Chinese city of Wuhan that is currently on lockdown due to fears of the virus turning into an epidemic.

Earlier in the day, the authorities of Huanggang, a city that is close to Wuhan and houses more than seven million people, have suspended planes and trains in and out of the city.

Patients with symptoms have experienced fever and difficulty breathing. Chest radiographs of those infected show invasive lesions on their lungs.

So far, Chinese authorities have confirmed 633 cases with 95 patients being in critical condition, while 17 people have already deceased due to the spread of the virus.
