                Brazos County investigating first suspected case of coronavirus in Texas

                
                
                
                    
                

            

        

    



                                    

                                
                                                
                        
            Brazos County’s health department is investigating a suspected case of the the mystery pneumonia-like virus that has claimed 18 lives in China and was confirmed in the U.S. for the first time earlier this week.


    
            The department said in a tweet that the patient had traveled from Wuhan, China, the district where the so-called 2019 novel coronavirus originated.


    
            The case would be the first for the state of Texas. Roughly 90 miles outside of Houston, Brazos County is home to the cities of Bryan and College Station, where Texas AM University is located.


    
            Another departmental tweet said health-care providers in the area were aware of public health guidance about the virus and quickly recognized the patient met the criteria for testing. The patient, a Texas AM student, is being kept isolated at home.


    
                                
            
                                

            
            MORE ON CORONAVIRUS: Snakes could be the original source of the new outbreak in China


    
                                            
                    
            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which confirmed a case Monday, a man in his 30s under observation in Washington state, is currently screening travelers from China at airports in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York as part of early efforts to prevent the virus’ spread in the United States.


    
            Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport tweeted earlier this week that federal agencies so far have seen no need for passengers at Houston Airports to be screened for signs of the virus. On Thursday, the airport tweeted that the Transportation Security Administration has determined that health alert flyers will be posted at all their airport checkpoints. The flyers advise travelers from Wuhan to call a doctor and tell them they were in the district if they become sick within two weeks of leaving.
