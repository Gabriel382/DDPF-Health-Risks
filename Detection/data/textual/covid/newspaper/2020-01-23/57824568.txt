Energy names tumble as China virus worries smack crude prices 
 The energy sector (XLE ) is today's weakest performing group in a broader market that trades modestly lower, as the spread of the coronavirus from China sparks worries of reduced fuel demand and weaker economic growth.

The sector has been a pocket of relative weakness this week and is now since Friday, while WTI crude has plunged 6.3% to within a dollar of the $54.07/bbl November low.

The potential for a pandemic has stirred memories of the 2002-03 SARS epidemic, which also started in China and dented economic growth and led to a slump in travel.

"We estimate a price shock of up to $5/bbl if the crisis develops into a SARS-style epidemic based on historical oil price movements," JPM Commodities Research says.

Among noteworthy movers in the sector: MRO , PXD , EOG , APA , COP , OXY , SLB , XOM .
