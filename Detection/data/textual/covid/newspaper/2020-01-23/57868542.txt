Chinese Coronavirus Patients Seemingly Transported in Boxes, Plastic Tubes to Prevent Infections 
 In one of the videos, shared by Radio Free Asia, a patient seemingly infected with the virus in the Chinese city of Huizhou in the southern Guangdong province is taken out of an ambulance in a large plastic tube by medical workers wearing protective clothing. In another video tweeted by Xie Qing, a journalist in Hong Kong, a patient appears to be transported through an airport in a large metal box with wheels and windows.

One person in the US has been infected with the virus. Authorities have not yet released the man’s identity, but he is described as being in his 30s and contracted the virus after a recent visit to China.

​According to Dr. George Diaz, who is helping treat the patient at the Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington, the patient is quarantined in a 20-foot-by-20-foot bio-containment room and is also being treated by a robot with a stethoscope to limit doctors’ potential contact with the virus, the Guardian reported. At least 16 people who had contact with the patient are being monitored closely, although none of them have shown any symptoms yet.
