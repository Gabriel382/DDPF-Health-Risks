Worries about the coronavirus accelerated somewhat after Beijing locked down additional cities in an effort to contain the spread of the disease, which is being compared with a deadly outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2002-03 that killed about 800 people.

Chinese officials have so far locked down Huanggang, a city of 7.5 million people,while a smaller city Ezhou, with population of million, said it also would restrict travel, the Wall Street Journal reported. The lock downs follow reports earlier that officials in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and the origin of the virus, had instituted travel restrictions.
