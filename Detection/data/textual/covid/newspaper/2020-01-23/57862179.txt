U.S. oil futures mark lowest settlement since late November 
 Oil futures fell sharply on Thursday, sending U.S. prices to their lowest settlement since late November, as the spread of coronavirus raised worries about the global economy and energy demand. "All markets are watching the situation with China" and the coronavirus, said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. "Energy markets could see a rather [large] impact on demand, especially if this virus gets worse." March West Texas Intermediate oil CLH20, -1.78% fell $1.15, or 2%, to settle at $55.59 barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the lowest front-month contract finish since Nov. 29, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
