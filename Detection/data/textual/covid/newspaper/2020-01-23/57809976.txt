ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 23rd Jan, 2020 ) :Pakistan has started screening all the passengers arriving from China after the breakout of coronavirus there, causing respiratory diseases in animals, birds and humans. 
"In view of the current outbreak of coronavirus in China, Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has introduced new screening measures to prevent the virus from entering the country through air travelers," a CAA press release said. 
The authority said screening measures focused on screening all the passengers coming in from China to Islamabad through 17 weekly flights "for possible symptoms that the deadly virus causes."

In case someone is identified as the virus-carrier, he/she would be kept in isolation rooms designated by the CAA for such passengers till their shifting to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) hospital to keep the patient in quarantine.
