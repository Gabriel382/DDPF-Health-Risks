Trump Says He Trusts Chinese President to Deal With Coronavirus, US Has It ‘Totally Under Control’ 
 The CDC on Tuesday said a resident of Snohomish County, Washington, who was returning from China, was diagnosed with the coronavirus. The CDC and Homeland Security began screening people travelling to major airports in California and New York from Wuhan – the province where the virus outbreak believed to have started. Health officials have also confirmed cases in Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.

Trump added that he believes that Chinese President Xi Jinping and health officials there are going to continue to tell authorities around the world everything they need to know about the virus.

The coronavirus, whose symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, which can progress to pneumonia, evoked memories of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China. SARS killed nearly 800 people worldwide and led to an economic downturn in the region, hitting Asian cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei and Beijing.
