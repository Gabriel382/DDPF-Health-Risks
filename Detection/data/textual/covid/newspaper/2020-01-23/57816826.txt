 Vietnam has reported its first coronavirus case in the country, the county’s health ministry announced Thursday.

Vietnam’s Health Ministry said a father from China and his son were sent to the hospital with fevers and have tested positive with the new virus. The ministry announced the father Li Ding, 66, came to the country from Wuhan on Jan. 13 and eventually met up with his son Li Zichao, 28, The Associated Press reported.

The father experienced a fever on Jan. 17, and three days later, the son had the same symptoms, said Dr. Nguyen Ngoc Sang, the head of tropical diseases at Cho Ray hospital in Ho Chi Minh city, according to the AP.

“The son has contracted the virus from his father,” the doctor said.

China has quarantined Wuhan and two other cities, Huanggang and Ezhou, to prevent the spread of the disease, which can be spread from human-to-human contact. Wuhan has reported almost 600 confirmed cases and 17 deaths associated with the virus.
