 Traders work on the floor at the NYSE in New York

(Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open lower on Thursday on rising worries over the coronavirus outbreak in China that prompted a lockdown of two cities in the country, while a mixed bag of results added to the dour sentiment.

"There is some concern that this will turn from an epidemic to a pandemic," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.

However, Pavlik added it was a reason for investors to take some profits in an "overbought" market.
