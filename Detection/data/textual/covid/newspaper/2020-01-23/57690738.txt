University of Minnesota student jailed in China over critical tweets, report says 
 China has arrested and sentenced a student that had allegedly posted tweets critical of Chinese President Xi Jinping while studying at the University of Minnesota, a report said Wednesday.

Luo Daiqing, 20, was first detained in July in his hometown of Wuhan — which has made news for the spread of the deadly coronavirus — where he had returned at the end of the spring semester, documents reviewed by Axios show.

Luo allegedly “created a negative social impact” by tweeting more than 40 comments “denigrating a national leader’s image and indecent pictures,” Axios reported.

Images that Luo is said to have tweeted included Lawrence Limburger — a cartoon villain from the 1993 “Biker Mice from Mars” TV show — who happens to resemble Xi. 

Luo also allegedly retweeted several images of honey-loving Winnie the Pooh, whose image is censored in China after people compared Christopher Robin’s bear to the Chinese leader.

A spokesman for the University told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that school officials did not have any information about the situation.

China has recently started cracking down on speech. Government officials were recently seen torching banned books, chopping “freedom of thought” from university charters and even fining churches. 

Meanwhile, the Chinese government has also ramped up its propaganda against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong — which includes the release of a video game called “Everyone Hit the Traitors.”
