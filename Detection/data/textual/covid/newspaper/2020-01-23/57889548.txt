'Coronavirus outbreak no time to panic but Matt Hancock close to sounding blasé' 
 It is understandable people are alarmed by the coronavirus outbreak, but the Government has a fine line to tread.

It must be careful not to whip up public panic - or sound complacent.

So far no cases are confirmed, though five people are being tested in Scotland.

It is a reminder that we remain at risk from new strains of diseases and viral infections.

We should also remember that such health scares are not new and sensible preventative measures have so far contained new threats.

It is right that precautions have been put in place and the NHS stands ready to respond if any cases are confirmed in the UK.

However Health Secretary Matt Hancock came close to sounding blasé when he updated MPs today.

We also need to learn from the Ebola outbreak where ministers were slow to bring in tighter controls and screening at airports.

When people’s lives are at risk we should not be making the same mistake twice.

A report by the spending watchdog today blames the spiralling cost of HS2 firmly on ministers’ blundering.

No surprise, given who was running the Department of Transport until recently.

Chris Grayling was one of the most incompetent people ever to hold a Government post.

The danger is this report will be used by Boris Johnson as an excuse to scrap HS2.

The mounting cost is concerning but the case for the high speed rail line is compelling, The unions, business leaders and politicians in the North and Midlands still back it.

This great project should not be made to pay the price for Tory incompetence.

Adventurer Lewis Pugh has become the first person to swim under the Antarctic ice sheet.

Given how cold the water is you could call it a lucky dip.
