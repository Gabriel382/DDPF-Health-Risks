Wall Street Rebounds With Record Highs After Early US Coronavirus Scare 
 The S&P 500, the leading equities index on the New York Stock Exchange, closed flat at 3,322 after hitting a record high OF 3,338. It closed down on Tuesday, despite setting a previous record, after news that a US traveller returning from China had contracted the novel Coronavirus, the worldâ€™s latest health scare.

The Nasdaq Composite also hit record highs on Wednesday. The technology-heavy index closed up 0.1 percent at 9,384, after an all-time high at 9,439.

Strong economic data and a pre-election rally have helped US stocks maintain a bull run from last year.

The S&P500 is up 2.8 percent for 2020, after a 30 percent gain last year.

The Nasdaq is up 4.5 percent year-to-date. The technology sector was the darling of Wall Street investors in 2019, lifting the Nasdaq by 36 percent.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 2.3 percent for 2020. It gained 23 percent in 2019.
