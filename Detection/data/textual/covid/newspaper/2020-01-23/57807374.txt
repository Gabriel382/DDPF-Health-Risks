Coronavirus outbreak: "5 or 6" people under observation in Canada, health minister says 
 Canadian Minister of Health Patty Hajdu said on Thursday that “five or six” people in Canada are under observation for potentially being ill with the novel coronavirus, though one person has already been cleared of having the virus.



Hajdu also said that airports in Canada have already begun to implement “a number of screening tools” to potentially identify signs of novel coronavirus among travelers, specifically with self-reporting measures.



The minister reiterated that that the risk “remains low” for Canadians to contract the new strain of coronavirus.



The coronavirus outbreak began last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China’s Hubei province. The vast majority of mainland China’s 571 cases have been in the city.



Other cases have been reported in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Thailand. One case was confirmed Thursday in Hong Kong after one was earlier confirmed in Macao. Most cases outside China were people from Wuhan or who had recently traveled there.
