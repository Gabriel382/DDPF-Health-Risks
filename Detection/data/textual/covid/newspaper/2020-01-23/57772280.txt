The Fort Worth-based airline’s fourth-quarter profit surged 27 percent year-over-year to $414 million on revenue of $11.3 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.15 per share were above the $1.14 that analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting. 
American has 24 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in its fleet and an additional 76 on order. The airline canceled about 10,000 flights in the fourth quarter as a result of the aircraft's March 2019 grounding, which came after two deadly crashes killed 346 passengers.
American “made important progress to address the issues that impacted our business in 2019,” CEO Doug Parker said in a statement. “While our results for the quarter reflect this progress, we know there is more work to be done.”
