 (Corrects erroneous letter in company name in paragraph 1) 
SHANGHAI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - InterContinental Hotels Group will allow customers to change or cancel stays scheduled up to Feb. 3 across mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan at no additional cost, the company said on its official WeChat account on Thursday.
