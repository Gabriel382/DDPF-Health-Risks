Passenger flying into LAX quarantined over potential coronavirus 
 A passenger flying from Mexico into Los Angeles was hospitalized and quarantined Wednesday night after displaying symptoms of the deadly new coronavirus strain, according to reports.

The traveler landed at LA International Airport Wednesday around 6:46 p.m. on American Airlines flight 2546, where they were met by police and firefighters, Fox 5 reports.

Firefighters conducted a “deep contamination process” after the passenger was taken to a local hospital, the outlet reported.

Symptoms of the virus include a fever, difficulty breathing and coughing, but authorities haven’t said which the traveler was displaying.

Authorities in China, where the outbreak began, say 17 people have died and more than 500 have been infected with the new virus.

Cases have also been reported in the US, Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.

Passengers are being screened for the virus at LAX, San Francisco International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport — the three ports that receive the most travelers from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus appears to have started.
