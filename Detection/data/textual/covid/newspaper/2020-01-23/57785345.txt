Coronavirus fears in Scotland as two Chinese patients in hospital 
 Coronavirus may have reached the UK as two Chinese travellers have been taken to hospital in Scotland with flu-like symptoms.

The unidentified patients are thought to be from Wuhan, the city at the heart of the outbreak which has killed 17 people and potentially infected thousands.

Tests have failed to rule out coronavirus. The patients are being treated at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
