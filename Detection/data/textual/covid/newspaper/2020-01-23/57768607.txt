 Have you encountered any precautionary measures for coronavirus?. If you have experienced any additional measures while travelling through airports, we would like to hear from you

Passengers who arrive at Heathrow from Wuhan in China will be asked to enter through a separate area as a precautionary measure to try and prevent the spread of coronavirus. Other countries are putting their own safeguards in place and we’d like to hear from people who have been affected.

We want to know about any additional measures you have encountered in airports in different countries following the coronavirus outbreak. Which airport were you travelling through and were people screened or asked to enter a different way? Do you feel that the measures were adequate?
