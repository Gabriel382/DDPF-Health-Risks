Student at Texas A&M University being treated for suspected case of novel coronavirus 
 COLLEGE STATION, Texas – Officials at the Brazos County Health District said Thursday they are investigating a suspected case of the 2019 novel coronavirus.

The male patient, who has been identified as a student at Texas A&M University, had traveled from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus that has made headlines in recent days first originated, officials said.

Doctors quickly related the patient’s mild symptoms to the novel coronavirus and the patient is undergoing tests to confirm the suspected diagnosis. The results of those tests will be announced to the public if the patient’s tests come back positive for the virus.

Officials said the patient is being kept isolated at home until the results of the tests are received. Health officials said it is safe for students to attend classes at Texas A&M University.

Officials are asking anyone who has traveled to Wuhan, China, and are suffering flu-like symptoms to call the Brazos County Health Department at 979-361-4440.

Health officials say the coronavirus produces symptoms similar to those of the flu. They include fever, cough, shortness of breath and a sore throat.
