Coronavirus outbreak: Manitoba Health says they're prepared to handle potential cases | FULL 
 Manitoba’s chief provincial public health officer says a plan is in place and Manitoba Health is ready should a potentially deadly infection make its way to the province.



Dr. Brent Roussin told media Thursday that public health officials are actively monitoring the coronavirus infection that originated in central China earlier this month.



“While the risk to Manitobans is low, health-care providers are asked to be aware of clients with relevant travel histories,” said Roussin, adding that those who head to emergency rooms or their doctors with fever or acute respiratory illness and have travelled to parts of China or been around those who have travelled in the past two weeks will be tested.



If that happens, that person will immediately be placed in a private room alone and put under “contact and droplet precautions,” said Roussin.



That means anyone who treats or visits the person will wear protective equipment to prevent transmission.
