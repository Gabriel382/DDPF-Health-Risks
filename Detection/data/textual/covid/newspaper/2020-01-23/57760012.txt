Copper slides further as China virus fears grow 
 LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Copper prices fell to their lowest in six weeks on Thursday due to the potential impact of the deadly coronavirus outbreak on economic activity in China as the death toll rises.

Other industrial metals also slipped, oil prices fell more than 1% and Chinese shares had their worst day since May while the yuan also suffered as China put two cities at the epicentre of the outbreak on lockdown.

Investors recalled the Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) epidemic in 2002-2003, which also started in China, dented economic growth and caused a slump in travel.

Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 0.4% at $6,081 a tonne at 1151 GMT, taking losses this week to around 3%.

"If the death toll rises and more and more people are caught by the virus, prices will come down much further," said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann.

TECHNICALS/POSITIONING: Speculators were liquidating long positions in copper and the price decline was triggering pre-set sell orders, brokers Marex Spectron said.

Copper was holding just above its 50-day moving average at $6,067. A move below this level would encourage technical selling.

STOCKS: Also weighing on prices is a sharp rise in stocks. On-warrant inventories in LME-registered warehouses rose to 162,875 tonnes from less than 90,000 tonnes last week. Stocks in China have also begun to rise   

SPREAD: Higher inventories barely shifted spreads, however, with the discount for LME cash copper against the three month contract fairly stable around $30. 

CHINA HOLIDAYS: Chinese markets will be closed from Friday, to Jan. 31 for the Lunar New Year, reducing liquidity.

PBOC: China's central bank kept the interest rate on its targeted medium-term lending facility (TMLF) unchanged on Thursday, confounding expectations for a cut.

CHINA SCRAP IMPORTS: China's scrap metal imports in 2019 fell 41.5% from a year ago, with the December intake sinking by 75.2%, customs data showed.

SUPPLY: Anglo American said its copper output fell 13% in the fourth quarter. A copper and cobalt refinery in Zambia and copper mine in Namibia are set to halt activity in the next two months, union official said.

NICKEL: Indonesia's nickel ore output more than doubled in 2019 to 52.8 million tonnes, an official said.

LEAD SPREAD: LME cash lead moved to a $4.75 premium against three-month metal from a discount of more than $20 earlier this month, pointing to tighter nearby supply. One entity controls between 80% and 90% of warrants.  <0#LME-WHL>

OTHER METALS: LME lead was down 0.1% at $1,984.50 a tonne, aluminium was 0.8% lower at $1,796.50, zinc fell 0.7% at $2,379.50, nickel slipped 1.9% to $13,385 and tin was down 1.4% at $17,185.
