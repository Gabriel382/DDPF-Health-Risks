US issues heightened travel warning for China amid deadly coronavirus outbreak 
 The US State Department has raised the threat level for travel to China, urging visitors there to exercise “increased caution” as the deadly coronavirus grips the country.

Officials encouraged travelers to the center of the outbreak in Wuhan to avoid contact with sick people and to reconsider visiting animal markets, which are the suspected source of the deadly epidemic.

The latest advisory comes as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has raised its own travel notice for Wuhan to the highest of three levels.

“CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Wuhan, China,” the center said.

Health officials recommended that travelers “remain alert if traveling to other parts of China,” which as a whole has a level-one status, encouraging people to “practice usual precautions.”

Anyone who visits the country and experiences symptoms of the virus such as a fever, cough or difficulty breathing is urged to seek medical care, as well as avoid contact with others, officials said.

Meanwhile, some hotel chains are waiving fees for guests who change or cancel reservations at locations in China.

Hilton Hotel properties will allow guests to cancel or re-book stays at properties between Jan. 21 and Feb. 8, according to Fox Business. Hyatt Hotels also said that cancellation fees will be waived for stays in areas most likely affected by the virus outbreak.

The novel coronavirus — which can be transmitted from person to person — has sickened around 634 people and killed 17.
