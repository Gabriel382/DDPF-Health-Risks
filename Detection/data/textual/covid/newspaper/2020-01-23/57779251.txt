Coronavirus victim wheeled out of airport in quarantine box in Shanghai 
 FOOTAGE has emerged showing a suspected coronavirus victim being wheeled out of an airport — in a quarantine box.

The man inside the box was isolated from other travellers and forced to wear a protective suit, a mask and gloves after he reportedly showed symptoms during a screening test.

Surrounded heavily by staff wearing blue masks, the man is wheeled into a waiting ambulance outside a terminal at the airport in Fuzhou in south-eastern China.

The number of deaths in China jumped to 25 on Thursday as the outbreak — which began in the central city of Wuhan — spread to other countries and the epicentre was locked down amid fears it could become a global pandemic.

Nearly 20million people in Wuhan, Huanggang and Ezhou — all in the Hubei province — have been banned from travelling as experts fear the deadly virus is becoming impossible to contain.

It is suspected that it emerged from illegally traded wildlife and one study by medical experts suggests it may have originated in snakes, with a link to bats.

China has reported more than 600 cases of the virus, which is believed to have originated at a market that sold live animals and seafood.

Government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan had also identified badgers and rats as possible sources.

Heathrow and airports around the world have introduced screening measures for passengers arriving from the affected region.
