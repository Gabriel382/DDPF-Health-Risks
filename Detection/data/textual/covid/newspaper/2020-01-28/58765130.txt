'Draconian' travel curbs needed to halt spread of virus: scientists 
 Governments need to implement "draconian" travel curbs to stop a mystery coronavirus in China becoming a global epidemic, a team of experts mapping the outbreak said Monday.  Scientists at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) presented a briefing warning that the spread of the deadly SARS-like virus that first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan was accelerating.  "We have to be prepared that this particular epidemic may be about to become a global epidemic," said Gabriel Leung, head of the team.
