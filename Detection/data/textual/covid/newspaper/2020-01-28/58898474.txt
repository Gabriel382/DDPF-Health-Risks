Coronavirus in 13 countries outside China, as death toll spikes 
 Britain has changed its travel advice advising against all but essential travel to the whole of mainland China, as a result of the new coronavirus. The number of deaths has now jumped to more than 100.

British nationals trapped in China have been urged to register with the consulate if they wish to be flown out – with suggestions an airlift “may happen quickly and with short notice”.

Japan and Germany have discovered cases of the virus in people with no history of travel to Wuhan, the city where it first emerged.

And a warning, there is flash photography from the start.
