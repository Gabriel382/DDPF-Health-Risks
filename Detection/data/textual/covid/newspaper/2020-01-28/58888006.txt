United Airlines suspends some flights between US and China as coronavirus spreads 
 The airline said in a statement that "significant decline in demand" has forced it to suspend flights from February 1 though February 8 between its US hubs and Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai.

In total, 24 round trips are affected. They are between Hong Kong to San Francisco and Newark; Beijing (PEK) to Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Newark; and Shanghai (PVG) to San Francisco, Newark and Chicago O'Hare.

"We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops and will adjust our schedule as needed," the airline said.

In a statement, American said "we have not adjusted our flight schedule at this time. We are continuing to closely monitor the situation." Delta did not immediately respond to CNN Business' request for comment. The coronavirus continues to spread.

Dozens of others have been infected worldwide, including at least five cases in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control has said it is now monitoring for symptoms of the virus among passengers arriving at 20 US airports.
