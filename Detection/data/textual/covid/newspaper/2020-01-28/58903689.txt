Why the Wuhan virus may be worse than Sars 
 Could the economic impact of the Wuhan coronavirus be worse than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2003? Unfortunately, it's possible, if not likely.

While it's still early days - we are less than one month on from the virus' first reported outbreak just after the new year - if you consider the state of China's economy today compared with what it was in 2003, the linkages it has with the region and the world and the economic importance of Wuhan itself, a worse-than-Sars scenario cannot be ruled out.
