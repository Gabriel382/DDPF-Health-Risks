Defensor tells public: Don’t engage in ‘hate campaign’ vs China amid virus scare 
 MANILA, Philippines — Anakalusugan Partylist Rep. Mike Defensor on Tuesday urged the public to avoid engaging in “hate campaign” against China amid the threat of novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.

Instead of engaging in this “hate campaign”, Defender said that Filipinos should instead sympathise with the sick and mourn the lives lost there.

“Gusto ko lang i-appeal kasi nakikita ko sa social media, may hate campaign against the Chinese. Tingin ko medyo mali ito. Huwag nating gawin yung ganun. Hindi naman nila ito kasalanan,” Defensor said at the Usapan sa Batasan press briefing in Quezon City.

For Defensor, the hate campaign is “unfair” and “unacceptable.”

“If at all, we must pray for the people of Wuhan or the people of China for their safety and for their health,” Defensor said.

Defensor said that various government agencies will be meeting with the World Health Organization (WHO) to discuss how to address novel coronavirus and other infectious diseases.

He also backed the Department of Health (DOH) in its call to avoid spreading fake news regarding novel coronavirus.

The health department on Tuesday said that the Philippines have 24 patients under investigation (PUIs) for the suspected novel coronavirus.

Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said most of the PUIs are from China.
