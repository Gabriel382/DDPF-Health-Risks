The novel coronavirus has sickened thousands and killed at least 100 people in China. The virus mainly sickens animals, but this specific coronavirus "jumped the species barrier" to infect people on a large scale, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Despite its impact in China, the CDC maintains that the risk to Americans is low.Reported illnesses have ranged from infected people with little or no symptoms to death, officials with the CDC said. Symptoms are similar to other respiratory illnesses. These viruses may cause mild to severe respiratory illnesses with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.WLWT will update this story as details develop.
