Dog Prevents Owner From Going To Coronavirus Hit Wuhan By Destroying Passport 
 Animals are known to have 6th sense. But dogs are also known for their nuisance. So when a dog tore off a woman’s passport right before she was to go to Wuhan, we cannot say for sure whether it was because it sensed some trouble or because it was just being naughty. 
The woman thanked her dog named Kimi, for chewing up her passport and stopping her from going on a trip to the coronavirus-hit city. The woman from Taiwan shared pictures of her tattered passport which her pooch had bitten chunks from.

 Since the middle of the month, Wuhan has been under lock-down following the spread of the deadly coronavirus. 
The massive scale of the outbreak and the fatalities it has been causing made the woman took her angry stance back and praise her dog.

As Wuhan remained under quarantine, she wrote ‘Do you guys remember the passport? Throwback: this kid is really protecting me’. 
She further wrote, 'After my passport was torn apart, the virus began to go where I originally planned to go.I think about it now, and it's very touching. Fortunately, you blocked our trip. 'Thanks for you protect me again. I'm so lucky to meet you in my life. Love you more my baby girl.'

Well, like we said it is not clear whether the dog sensed danger for her owner or was she just creating a nuisance- whatever be the case, she did save her owner.
