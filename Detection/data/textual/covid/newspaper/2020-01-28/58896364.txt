Chinese villagers wall themselves in to stop spread of coronavirus 
 Chinese villagers are building make-shift structures to wall themselves in to stop spread of the coronavirus. Villages across the country are sealing themselves off against the virus, which has killed more than 100 people so far. Check-points are also being set up to screen every one coming into their province. Meanwhile in Australia, the government has issued a warning to travellers, urging them to reassess any travels plans to China. Image: Getty
