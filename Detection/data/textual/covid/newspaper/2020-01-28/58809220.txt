METALS-Copper in longest losing streak in 6 years on China virus fears 
 The death toll from the virus outbreak in China rose to 81 on Monday, as the government extended the Lunar New Year holiday and more big businesses shut down or told staff to work from home in an effort to curb the spread. Copper, regarded as a bellwether of the global economy, has given up all of its gains since early December when a rally pushed prices up nearly 10% to eight-month highs as investors welcomed the first phase of a U.S.-China trade deal and hoped for a rebound in economic growth.

"Chinese demand accounts for about 50% of the majority of base metals and looking at the latest data regarding the coronavirus, it's now spread quite widely," said analyst Timothy Wood-Dow at BMO Capital in London. "On Friday, we didn't know this, it seemed quite contained. Now this wider geographical spread is very concerning, so that's feeding through to the market." It was possible that Chinese economic growth could still hit 6% this year if the virus is contained since the government was determined to bolster the economy, he added. "Probably infrastructure investment will just be pushed back later in the year."

Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) hit its lowest since Oct. 18 at $5,775 a tonne. It failed to trade in official open-outcry activity and was bid down 2% at $5,808 a tonne. Last week, LME copper posted its steepest weekly loss in five years, falling 5.5%, as the virus spread. "Fingers crossed we will get good earning reports this week from U.S. companies or else the panic selling will be even worse," a base metals trader, who asked not to be named, said.
