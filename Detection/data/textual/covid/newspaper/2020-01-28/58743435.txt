Q3 earnings mixed so far; brokerages maintain 'buy' on 10 stocks with 9-23% upside 
 After hitting new records, profit booking dragged benchmark indices from the highs. But buying in the last couple of sessions, helped recover some of the week's losses.

Mixed set of earnings from India Inc. and selling seen in the international markets on outbreak of the deadly coronavirus, kept investors cautious last week.

The 30-share pack Sensex touched a fresh all-time high of 42,273.87, while Nifty hit a fresh record high of 12,430.50 on January 20.

"We reiterate our cautious view on the Indian markets given the stretched valuation and muted start to the earnings season. The expectations are high from the budget as market participants pin hopes for additional measures from the government to revive the economy. This is likely to drive momentum in the markets in the coming sessions. Further, the earnings announcement from corporates would also induce stock specific volatility," Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking said.

Last week, the Sensex lost 332.18 points (-0.79 percent) to end at 41,613.19, while the Nifty shed 104.05 points (-0.80 percent) to end at 12,248.3.

While the BSE small-cap index was up 0.93 percent and the BSE mid-cap index added 0.72 percent, the BSE large-cap index was down 0.65 percent last week.

Couple of companies came out with their December quarter earnings. These included L&T, Axis Bank and SBI Life, among others.

With no major capex and aversion to capital allocation in the asset business, there is a high likelihood that L&T may announce special dividend to return excess cash to shareholders, especially as the new tax rules for buyback have made it redundant for the company to choose between the two options.

The company's Q3FY20 consolidated net profit rose 7.4 percent at Rs 201.2 crore versus Rs 195.7 crore, while revenue was down 9.9 percent at Rs 2,273.3 crore versus Rs 2,523.8 crore YoY.

Going forward, broking house expect domestic zinc demand to pick up on the back of incremental demand from key user industries, especially railways.

Indian Railways is setting targets to lay zinc-coated rails and has fitted stations with galvanised roofs to replace asbestos sheets, which augurs well for domestic zinc demand.

Additionally, the recent uptick in zinc and lead prices on the LME augurs well.
