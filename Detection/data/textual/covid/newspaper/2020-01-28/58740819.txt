Copper extends losses as China virus death toll climbs 
 Jan 28 (Reuters) - London copper prices slipped for a 10th straight session on Tuesday, hovering near a three-month low hit in the previous day, as fears mounted over the fast-spreading coronavirus in China and its potential economic impact.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) dipped 0.1% to $5,739 a tonne by 0732 GMT. The contract, widely used as a gauge of economic health, hit its lowest since Oct. 18, 2019 in the previous session at $5,726 a tonne.

"Copper is more sensitive to economic jitters than any other commodity, and the rising death toll in China is keeping prices depressed," said ANZ analyst Soni Kumari.

The death toll has climbed to 106 in China, while the number of confirmed cases has risen to 4,515.

The virus, which belongs to the same coronavirus family as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), is expected to hurt economic growth in the world's second-biggest economy as China stepped up preventive measures, imposed travel restrictions and extended the Lunar New Year holidays to limit the spread of the virus.

Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura warned that corporate profits and factory production might take a hit from the outbreak.

Meanwhile, the rest of the base metals complex rebounded. LME nickel advanced 1% to $12,745 a tonne from near a seven-month low hit in the previous session, aluminium was almost unchanged at $1,763.50 a tonne, zinc rose 0.2% to $2,243.50 a tonne and lead advanced 0.6% to $1,902.95 a tonne.

"The market is comparing (the new virus) with SARS in 2003, but we believe the economic impact will not to be as severe as 17 years ago. After the recent price slump, metals valuation looks cheap and could see a price rebound once things start normalising," Kumari said.

* SHFE: The Shanghai Futures Exchange said on Monday it would extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 and will reopen on Feb. 3, in line with the Chinese government's guideline to contain the outbreak.

* "I saw speculation selling on the way down but have not yet seen dip buyers. I doubt we've seen the end of this yet," said a base metal trader, noting that a strong selloff was expected when Chinese markets reopen.

* LEAD: LME-cancelled warrants lead stocks , or metal earmarked for delivery, climbed to 15,275 tonnes, the highest since July 9, 2019, while the premium of LME three-month over the cash contract  stretched to a near six-month high of $26.50 a tonne, indicating tight nearby supplies.

* "The sudden jump in cancelled warrants could result in inventory drawdowns in coming days," ING said in a note, referring to LME lead stocks.
