Aust scientists grow coronavirus in lab 
 Supplied video obtained Wednesday 29, 2020, of the Wuhan coronavirus growing in a laboratory at The Doherty Institute, Melbourne. It is the first time the virus has been grown in cell culture outside of China. The lab-grown virus, which was developed from an infected patient, will assist with the accurate diagnosis of the disease across the world. The virus is expected to be used to generate an antibody test, which allows detection of the virus in patients who haven't displayed symptoms and were therefore unaware they had it.
