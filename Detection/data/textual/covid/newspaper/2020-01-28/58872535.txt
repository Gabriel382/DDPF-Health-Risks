Niagara Health patient negative for coronavirus infection | The Star 
 Lab tests show a person under quarantine at the St. Catharines hospital does not have the coronavirus, according to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care.

In an email to The St. Catharines Standard, Ministry spokesman Travis Kann said the ministry received the lab results this morning. He did not answer questions about other possible coronavirus investigations in Niagara. The region’s medical officer of health, Dr. Musfata Hirji, said Monday he would not say if there were any investigations underway in Niagara.

The patient, who has not been identified, was isolated at the hospital after showing symptoms of respiratory illness and had travelled from the Wuhan region of China, where the virus originated. Under infection control protocols, anyone who meets those two criteria are isolated and tested.

In an email sent to Niagara Health staff Monday, Niagara Health executive vice president of clinical services Derek McNally said that based on the patient’s symptoms and travel history the patient was being tested.

There are 11 people being tested for possible infection with the virus in Ontario — down from the 19 announced Monday by the provincial medical officer of health. An investigation does not mean an infection has been confirmed. It will take 48 to 72 hours to confirm the lab results. Kann did not say why the results came back faster than expected.

If the tests are positive for coronavirus, the case will be deemed “presumptive” with a second battery of tests used to confirm the results. There is currently one confirmed case and one presumptive case of coronavirus in Ontario. So far, 106 people in China have died from the virus.

More to come.
