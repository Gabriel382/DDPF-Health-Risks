Coronavirus news: Infections could reach 'hundreds of thousands' in just 2 weeks - claim 
 The virus is believed to have been first contracted at a busy seafood market in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, where livestock is traded.
Dr Grzesiowski said: “The novel coronavirus is a zoonotic pathogen and it is assumed it originated in bats and has mutated in snake organisms, whose raw meat is eaten by the Chinese.
“Without this, the virus would rather not have any chances of moving onto humans.
“Another factor is the high density of the place, that was likely the first source of infection, that is, a large marketplace through which tens of thousands of people pass through every single day, which creates excellent conditions for the virus to pass from person to person.
