WA authorities await coronavirus results 
 Four adult patients are being tested for coronavirus in WA

West Australian authorities expect to learn later on Tuesday whether the state has its first confirmed case of the deadly coronavirus.

WA's chief health officer Andrew Robertson says four adult patients are being closely monitored as the health department awaits results from the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory.

"We have one case that, on our assessment, we believe is a more probable case. The other cases we think are low-risk," Dr Robertson told reporters.

"There are very good public health measures in place. These cases are being closely monitored and they are isolated if it's clinically required."

Dr Robertson would not confirm any further details about the suspect cases, including their ages or which hospitals they were being treated at.

"These are just suspect cases. They may well have just a minor infectious disease," he said.

"We will provide further details about confirmed cases.

"All of these cases have done the right thing. They've come to the hospital as required ... we're not concerned they currently pose any risk to the Perth population."

Several of WA's private schools have advised parents to quarantine their children if they have recently visited affected areas in China.

Department of Education director general Lisa Rodgers said it would be business as usual for most students when the state's public schools returned next week.

"If you have been in touch with a confirmed case of the virus, then we are asking you to stay at home for 14 days," she said.

"If not and you are well, schools will be open and come to school.

"Undoubtedly parents will be concerned ... we are working on a day-to-day basis with the health department and we will make sure that every part of their advice is enacted in our school system."
