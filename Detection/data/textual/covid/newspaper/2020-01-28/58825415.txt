Huge portions of the yield curve are inverted. Most of the inversions are by tiny amounts, but it's another warning.

With growing concern over the Coronavirus, yields dropped again today and portions of the yield curve are inverted out to seven years.

For example, the yield on the 7-year not is lower than the yield on the 1-year not and everything shorter in duration.

Yellow highlights show the yield on the 3-year, 2-year- and 1-year notes is each lower than the next shorter duration.

And the yield on the  long bond is again flirting with the 2% level.
