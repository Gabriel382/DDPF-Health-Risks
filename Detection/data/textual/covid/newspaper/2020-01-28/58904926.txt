Hong Kong heavily restricting travel with China as coronavirus spreads 
 Hong Kong is heavily restricting travel with mainland China in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus. Flights will be halved and ferries suspended to significantly reduce the flow of people between the territories. Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam stopped short of shutting the border but said the mainland would suspend issuing permits for visitors in 49 cities.
