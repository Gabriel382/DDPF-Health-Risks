US airlift leaves Wuhan


Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the novel coronavirus originating from Wuhan in China. 

This morning, the US has begun its first evacuation of citizens from Wuhan itself, in the Hubei province, where thousands of people have been affected.

The US state department confirmed to the Associated Press that 240 Americans – including diplomats and other citizens – have been airlifted out of the city, and will be flown to Anchorage in Alaska, and then to Ontario in California, 56 kilometres (35 miles) from Los Angeles. 

Data from publicly available flight tracking site Flightaware shows that a flight operated by American cargo airline Kalitta Air left Wuhan’s Tianhe airport today at 4.54 in the morning local time, and is due to touch down in Alaska in 6 hours from now. 

According to AP, all Americans will be screened for the virus in Anchorage, and could be quarantined in Ontario for up to two weeks by the US Centers for Disease Control. 


David Wert, a spokesman for the county of San Bernardino, said they were “preparing for that eventuality just in case”. 

Wert said that Ontario International Airport was designated a decade ago by the U.S. government to receive repatriated Americans in case of an emergency overseas. Airport personnel have trained for such an occasion but the repatriation from China would be the first time the airport is used for this purpose, he said.

In Ontario, the area where passengers will be taken is removed from passenger terminals and other public areas at the airport, the county said.
