Bengaluru man starts crowdfunding for sister's streptococcus pneumonia treatment in China 
 Manish Thapa, a Bengaluru resident, who works in Amazon has started crowdfunding for his sister, Preeti Maheshwari who is suffering from deadly streptococcus pneumonia, Type 1 respiratory failure, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) and septic shock.

Preeti was admitted to the emergency ward of Shekou Hospital in China on January 11. She is a primary school Art teacher in International School of Science and Technology, Shenzhen and also has two school-going daughters.

According to Manish, the cost of his sister's treatment is increasing every day and needs around Rs 1 crore. The woman has started responding positively to the treatment.

"Preeti is suffering from streptococcal pneumonia and the treatment is expensive. Many thought this was Coronavirus but it was misinterpreted and misquoted. This is not Coronavirus," Manish, her brother, said.

As per reports, many others, too, are drawing inspiration from Manish and have sought crowdfunding for expensive treatments in India.
