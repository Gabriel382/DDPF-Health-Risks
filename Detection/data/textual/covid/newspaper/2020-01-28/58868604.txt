Foreigner in Camiguin negative for 2019-nCoV, says DOH 
 CAGAYAN DE ORO - A foreigner who underwent tests in Camiguin Provincial Hospital tested negative for novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV, the Department of Health said Tuesday.

After showing symptoms like fever, cough and colds, the foreigner voluntarily went to a hospital to be tested. The patient came from Wuhan, China before coming to Camiguin for vacation.

"Gagawin lamang natin ang confirmatory test kapag nag-positive sa unang test. Pero dahil negative siya sa initial testing, so no need for confirmatory test. Kaya cleared na namin siya at discharged na sa hospital," Dr. Ian Gonzales of Communicable Diseases DOH-10 said.



“The province has instituted mandatory protocols in monitoring and safeguarding the possible introduction [of the virus] in our territory,” said Provincial Health Officer II Gretchen Cabalang of the Camiguin General Hospital.

In case the health department has a patient under investigation in Region 10, the person will be taken to the Northern Mindanao Medical Center in Cagayan de Oro where isolation facilities and medical personnel are available. -Report from Rod Bolivar, ABS-CBN News
