This could be the ‘disease X’ health experts fear – but we should have a test vaccine in just 16 weeks 
 The novel coronavirus – now designated 2019-nCoV – that emerged from Wuhan City, China just a few weeks ago confronts the world with a new and concerning disease that is spreading fast.

The risks to global health and security are mounting and we must deploy all our tools in an urgent effort to contain it.

As of Tuesday, January 27, the 2019-nCoV virus is confirmed to have infected at least 4,500 people and claimed 107 lives, but it is clear that the reported number of persons with confirmed infection is only a fraction of the number that have actually been infected.

The apparent determination that the virus has been transmitted to others by people with no obvious symptoms means that it will be very, very difficult, if not impossible, to control.

The virus has now spread beyond Wuhan in China, with cases identified so far in ten additional nations, including some, such as France, Canada, and the United States that are far from the epidemic’s epicenter. It seems only a matter of time before cases are confirmed in the UK.
