GPs 'hope' the govt will 'help out' during a 'pandemic' 
 President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) Dr Harry Nespolon says general practioners are wanting to be included in the government’s “disaster planning” in the future. Dr Nespolon told Sky News host Chris Kenny GPs are often required to help “without any assistance, without any direction and without any resources” in the case of a “pandemic”. Australia is facing a shortage of facemasks following a period of high demand throughout the nation’s bushfire season and now as protection against the coronavirus. Dr Nespolon said as a “public health issue” he was hoping the “government would be helping out by supplying some of these masks”. Although “the state and federal health departments have been doing their very best” in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, he said, “personal responsibility” must be taken when it comes to addressing personal health issues.
