Doctor Copper Catches Coronavirus With Worst Performance In 34 Years 
 Copper prices are down 9 straight days - the longest streak of losses for the commodity with an economics PhD since 1986!

And, it appears that other lifeblood of the global economy is also not buying what stocks are selling...

And bonds continue to disagree with stocks' exuberance...

Still - if Powell promises to save the world by printing more money - potentially to use as homemade masks - then why not keep buying stocks? What could go wrong?
