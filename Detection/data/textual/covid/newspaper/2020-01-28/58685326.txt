Indonesian Health Ministry Steps Up Coronavirus Countermeasures 
 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Indonesian Health Ministry has reportedly prepared at least three countermeasures that could effectively prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading into Indonesia. First is by beefing up the security in entranceways where foreigners mostly pass such as airports and seaports. The ministry has also stationed guards equipped with thermal scanners which have become the standard procedure in tackling the coronavirus outbreak. The director-general of prevention and disease control Anung Sugihantoro said members of the ministry have started to actively use its thermal scanners, apart from the static ones stationed at entrance gates, to check passengers on board an airplane, especially those arriving from China. “People don’t get off the plane to be checked but we are the ones going on board,” said Anung.A second coronavirus countermeasure is by enacting a health alert card to control and keep track of people arriving from overseas. The health card will specifically help people check into hospitals if symptoms eventually show up 14-days after their arrival in Indonesia. The third attempt is by requesting for a special area in Angkasa Pura II’s airport aprons to be used as a temporary quarantine area if an airplane’s passenger has been detected. FIKRI ARIGI
