 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Manpower Minister Ida Fauziyah is awaiting Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto's steps over the restrictions on the number of Chinese workers employed in Indonesia amid the coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Â "I think we should follow government policy as a whole. Will it apply to foreign workers or foreign nationals visiting Indonesia? We will follow the Health Ministry," Fauziyah said in the Presidential Palace compound in Jakarta Tuesday.There has been no specific policy restricting the number of Chinese workers to be employed in Indonesia, the minister said.The policy needs to urgently respond to the outbreak of coronavirus which was first detected in Wuhan, she said."No, (there has not been policy to that effect)," she added.Based on statistical data, 32,209 Chinese workers were employed in Indonesia in 2018. Most of them were employed in projects and offices of multinational companies from China.Nearly 10 percent or 900 thousand of nine million Indonesian migrant workers abroad are employed in China, several sources such as the World Bank and the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) said.ANTARA
