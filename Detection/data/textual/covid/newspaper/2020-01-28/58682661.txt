Amid coronavirus outbreak, Wuhan residents confront fear, government distrust 
 Chris Buckley:

            There is concern, but, at the same time, the stores that I have been able to visit over the past few days, there's food available. There's fresh produce on the shelves.
Today, I went to buy some oranges for myself and didn't have any trouble. And there were other residents flowing out to buy turnips, carrots, cucumbers, apples, and also a load of tinned food as well, not so much meat.
So, food supply seems OK. Now, again, I think the experience of residents might vary a bit though. But I think, if you're elderly, for example, and you used to go to the shop downstairs to buy your food, now you might have to walk one or two miles or a mile or two in some areas to buy your groceries. And that's going to be difficult.
You might have friends and family who can help, but they're also going to be have a lot â€” having a lot of difficulty moving around town.
