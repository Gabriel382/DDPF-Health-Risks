 Coronavirus death toll in China mounts to 81

BEIJING: A new viral illness being watched with a wary eye around the globe accelerated its spread in China with 81 deaths so far, while the US Consulate in the city at the epicentre announced it will evacuate its personnel and some other Americans aboard a chartered flight.
China’s health minister said the country was entering a “crucial stage” as “it seems like the ability of the virus to spread is getting stronger.”
US President Donald Trump offered China any help needed on Monday to control a coronavirus outbreak. Beijing authorities reported the capital’s first coronavirus death on Monday - a 50-year-old person who had been to Wuhan, state media said.
The total number of confirmed cases in China rose to 2,835, about half in Hubei. Some experts suspect a much higher number. The number of deaths from the virus in Hubei climbed to 76 from 56, officials said, with five deaths elsewhere in China.
Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has had eight cases, banned entry to people who had visited Hubei in the past 14 days.
Some European tour operators cancelled trips to China and offered customers refunds. And governments from Japan to Spain were working on repatriating nationals from the Wuhan area.
Malaysia also imposed a temporary ban on Chinese nationals arriving from Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
The government decided to impose the temporary ban with immediate effect following the rising death toll in China.
Malaysia has reported four confirmed cases of the virus, which can cause pneumonia. It is still unclear how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.
