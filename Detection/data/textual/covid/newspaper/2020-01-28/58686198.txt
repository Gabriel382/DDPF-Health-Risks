Surgical masks selling out across US amid fears over coronavirus 
 Sales of surgical-style masks at U.S. pharmacies have reportedly begun selling out in Seattle and other U.S. cities amid fears of the spread of a new form of coronavirus.

The BBC reported Monday that higher rates of sales have been reported in Seattle, New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.

"I immediately ordered a box of masks online after I heard of the first US case," one Chinese student at the University of Washington told the news service.

However, the rush of sales may come at no benefit for buyers: Researchers dispute whether the masks are effective when worn in public, and argue that they are more effective to prevent the transmission of the disease from those who already have it.

"There's little harm in it," Eric Toner, of the  Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security told Business Insider of the masks. "But it's not likely to be very effective in preventing it."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Monday that the number of confirmed cases of a new form of coronavirus involved in an outbreak that has sickened hundreds of people in China.

The virus, believed to have originated in China's Wuhan province, is thought to not be easily transmissible between humans, though it is possible. Chinese officials announced Sunday that 769 new cases of the virus had been reported in a 24-hour period.

Symptoms of the illness include a form of pneumonia that has killed about 81 people with the disease.
