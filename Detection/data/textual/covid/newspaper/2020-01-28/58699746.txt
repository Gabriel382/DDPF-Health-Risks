(Update) Japan Decides to Designate New Pneumonia as Specified Disease - JIJI PRESS 
 Tokyo, Jan. 28 (Jiji Press)--The government decided Tuesday to designate pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus raging in China as a specified infectious disease in a bid to prevent the virus from spreading in Japan. 

    The government adopted at a cabinet meeting an ordinance for the designation under the infectious disease law, which will allow authorities to conduct compulsory hospitalizations of infected patients and stop them from attending work.

    Under the ordinance, set to take effect Feb. 7, the disease will also be designated as a quarantinable infectious disease under the quarantine law.

    This designation will allow authorities to order visitors to Japan to take screenings if infections are suspected. Those who refuse can be punished.

    "We'll take all possible measures to prevent the infections from spreading by securing the effectiveness of countermeasures, such as compulsory hospitalizations and checkups for those who may be infected," health minister Katsunobu Kato told a press conference.
