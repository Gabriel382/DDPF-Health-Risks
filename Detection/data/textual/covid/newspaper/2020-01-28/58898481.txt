Parents receiving conflicting advice over coronavirus outbreak 
 The coronavirus outbreak is creating headaches for parents who have received conflicting advice from different authorities. According to federal advice, students have been told to stay home only if they are exhibiting flu-like symptoms or if they have been in contact with someone infected with the virus. However in WA and NSW, state governments have barred all students from returning to school this week if they travelled to China in the summer holidays. NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell told Sky News “we came to the view that there’s no harm in going a bit further, no harm in going that extra precautionary step”. “This is up to state governments to decide how they’d like to respond and I do think we’ve made the right decision.” Image: Getty
