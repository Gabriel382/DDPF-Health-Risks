 A United Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner sits parked at the terminal at San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco, California.

United Airlines on Tuesday said it would suspend dozens of China flights next month because of a "significant decline in demand" to the country as it battles the growing number of coronavirus cases.

United has the most service to China of the U.S. airlines.

The flight cancellations take effect Feb. 1 and last through Feb. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if United would cancel more flights.
