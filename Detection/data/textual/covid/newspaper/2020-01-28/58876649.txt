Chinese soccer team competes in empty Shanghai stadium amid coronavirus fears 
 An international soccer match in China had to be played to a completely empty stadium amid heightening fears about the coronavirus, according to a report.

No fans attended the match as Shanghai SIPG took on Thailand’s Buriam United on Tuesday at Yuanshen Sports Centre Stadium in Shanghai, according to Fox Sports Asia.

Buriam had urged the Asia Football Confederation to postpone the game as the deadly virus sweeps through China — but local officials instead decided to hold the playoff game behind closed doors, ESPN reported.

Players from both teams were seen arriving Tuesday wearing face masks to protect them from the virus, which has now killed more than 100 people in China and sickened around 4,500 others.

Shanghai SIPG went on to win the game 3-0 in their empty stadium.
