Deadly coronavirus feared to have infected luxury celebrity hotspot 
 A luxury hotel that has housed the likes of Taylor Swift is at the centre of fresh coronavirus fears after a guest was rushed to hospital with unusual symptons.

Paramedics wearing full-body hazmat suits and masks were seen arriving at Peppers Broadbeach, Broadbeach, in Australia's Gold Coast after a man who recently flew in from China was taken ill.

The A-list hotspot, which costs $911 (Â£472) a night, was swarmed by emergency services at Tuesday lunchtime and a man was taken by ambulance to Gold Coast University Hospital for further testing.

The Gold Coast Bulletin reports that the unnamed patient was displaying symptoms similar to those who have already died of coronavirus.

The man had recently visited China and had returned to the Gold Coast, the newspaper states.

Police were also at the scene ready to help with crowd control, and to establish a quarantined area if it was needed.

The luxury 4.5-star hotel was home to Taylor and her then-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston in 2016 when they stayed for a visit.



 The couple ensconced themselves in the three-bedroom penthouse while Tom was out filming for Thor 3: Ragnarok.

Coronavirus has already killed 82 people after appearing to have infected a person or people at an open-air live animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

Nearly 3,000 are officially confirmed to have the fast-spreading respiratory infection, which does not yet have a cure or preventative vaccine.

But experts believe the number of infected people is far higher - perhaps as many as 100,000, as many carriers could be asymptomatic for days while unknowingly passing on the infection to others.
