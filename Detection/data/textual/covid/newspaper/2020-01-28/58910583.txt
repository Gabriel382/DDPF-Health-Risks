South Korea Consumer Confidence 
 The Composite Consumer Sentiment Index (CCSI) in South Korea climbed to 104.2 in January 2020 from 100.4 in the previous month, well above market expectations of 97.5 points. All six sub-indexes increased, with future domestic economic conditions rising the most (+5 points to 87), followed by current domestic economic conditions (+4 points to 78). Both current living standards (93 points) and future household spending (110 points) only gained one point. The print takes into account favourable trade policy evolution and rebounding manufacturing activity, but fails to capture the effects of the novel coronavirus in Asia.

Consumer Confidence in South Korea is expected to be 92.00 points by the end of this quarter, according to Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations. Looking forward, we estimate Consumer Confidence in South Korea to stand at 96.00 in 12 months time. In the long-term, the South Korea Consumer Confidence is projected to trend around 99.00 points in 2020, according to our econometric models.
