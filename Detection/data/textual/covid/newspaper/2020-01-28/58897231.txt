Coronavirus drives people to download epidemic-simulating video game Plague Inc. 
 Fear and intrigue surrounding the coronavirus has lead people to download a simulation video game where players use real-time strategy to spread a deadly outbreak around the world.

Now, the video game's developers are warning people not to take the game too seriously, and to seek advice about how epidemics travel from authoritative sources.

The coronavirus has sickened more than 4,500 people and killed over 100, authorities say. The illness seemingly originated in China before swiftly moving to other parts of the globe, including the U.S.

Plague Inc. is an eight-year-old app and PC game where users play the role of a disease intent on infecting the world with a pathogen.

UK-based game developer Ndemic Creations said the game has seen a surge in users recently as news about the coronavirus spread. The video game maker also issued a reminder to players that Plague Inc. is not based on science.

"Whenever there is an outbreak of disease we see an increase in players, as people seek to find out more about how diseases spread and to understand the complexities of viral outbreaks," Ndemic Creations said in a statement on its website. “We specifically designed the game to be realistic and informative, while not (sensationalizing) serious real-world issues."

The company also included a link to information from the World Health Organization about coronavirus. The influx of new players caused the app developer's website to shut down last week, NdemicCrations tweeted.

PC Mag reports that the game has become the most-downloaded iPhone app in China and in the United States over the past week.
