Despite coronavirus, nuclear weapons remain 'number one risk' to humanity 
 Coronavirus poses a deadly threat to the health of the world, but nuclear weapons remain the main concern to the threat of the continuation of humanity, according to the Lowy Institute’s Sam Roggeveen. Speaking with Sky News host Tom Connell, the Director of International Security Program said the “arsenal” of nuclear weapons around the world is the “number one risk” to humanity. “The doomsday clock change that happened is a useful opportunity to remind ourselves that there are thousands of nuclear weapons across the world,” he said. “Iran is not going to be a danger point in this coming year, simply because they do not have nuclear weapons yet. “North Korea on the other hand already has nuclear weapons and we shouldn’t forget about the possibility of a crisis across the Taiwan strait.”
