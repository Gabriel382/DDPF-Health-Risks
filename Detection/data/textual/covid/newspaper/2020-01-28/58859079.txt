Coronavirus disrupts school start in NSW 
 NSW parents are asked to keep their kids at home if their children have recently been in China

Children who recently visited China are facing a delayed start to their school year as the NSW government moves to soothe classroom concerns over coronavirus infections.

Parents in NSW have been asked to keep their kids at home when school returns if their children have been in China within the past 14 days.

The federal education minister has chastised schools for suggesting students stay home, however NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the state was in a unique situation.

The state government announced the decision on Tuesday evening as parents prepared for their children to return to school on Wednesday.

"Ideally we would have liked to have been in a position to have made this decision earlier. It is a very difficult decision," Mr Hazzard said.

Some schools had approached the state government to air concerns about the spread of coronavirus, Mr Hazzard said.

NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said the government was responding to these concerns by making the request to parents as a precaution.

"We know many in the community have wanted to see this and we are taking this step in line with community sentiment," she said.

"We are doing everything we can, even though the risk is low, to ensure the safety of our children."

There have been four confirmed cases of the potentially-lethal coronavirus in NSW, and one further case confirmed in Victoria.
