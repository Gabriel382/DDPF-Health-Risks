Germany, Japan and Taiwan report first coronavirus patients who didn’t visit China 
 Germany, Japan and Taiwan have reported the first cases of coronavirus in patients who didn’t personally visit China, according to reports.

The new cases all involve people who contracted the deadly illness outside of China from someone else who went to the epidemic-stricken country, where more than 4,500 people have been diagnosed.

Germany said a man in Bavaria tested positive for the virus, and his employer added Tuesday that the patient worked in Stockdorf and became infected after another employee visited from China.

The company — German car-parts-supplier Webasto — said the employee who went to China had tested positive for the virus upon returning.

In Japan, a tour-bus operator from Nara contracted the virus after driving two groups from the Chinese city of Wuhan, which is the epicenter of the outbreak, Japanese outlet NHK reported.

The patient, who is in his 60s, began complaining of chills and a cough Jan. 14 before he was diagnosed Tuesday, the report said.

Taiwan also confirmed a case of domestic transmission of the coronavirus involving a 50-year-old man.

The man, who lives in central Taiwan, became infected by his wife after she returned from working in China, according to the Central Epidemic Command Centre. She was later diagnosed herself for the flu-like virus.

The World Health Organization says the incubation period for the virus is between two and 10 days.

The group said Tuesday that more information is needed to determine whether the illness can spread before an infected person experiences symptoms.

“Understanding the time when infected patients may transmit the virus to others is critical for control efforts,” the organization said.
