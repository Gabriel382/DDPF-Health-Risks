UnitedHealth Beat on Earnings Then Peaked a Week Later 
 UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) provides managed health care products and insurance services, and the stock is a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company beat earnings per share (EPS) estimates for the 25th consecutive quarter on Jan. 15. The stock continued higher and peaked, setting its all-time intraday high of $302.54 on Jan. 21. This put the stock above its annual pivot at $297.29, which failed to hold on Jan. 24 following the coronavirus scare.

The stock closed Monday, Jan. 27, at $284.09, down 3.4% so far in 2020. It is 6.1% below its all-time intraday high of $302.54 set on Jan. 21 and in bull market territory at 36.5% above its April 17, 2019 low of $208.07. Fundamentally, UnitedHealth stock is overvalued with a P/E ratio of 19.38 and a dividend yield of 1.48%, according to Macrotrends.

Shares of UnitedHealth have had ups and downs. There was a bear market decline of 27.7% from the intraday high of $287.94 set on Dec. 4 to the April 17 low of $208.07. This was followed by a bull market rally of 28% to its high of $266.51 posted on July 18, 2019. UnitedHealth stock then declined by a bear market 20.4% to its Oct. 1 low of $212.08. From this low to the all-time high of $302.54, there was a bull market rise of 42%.

Consumers looking for health insurance from UnitedHealth should be aware that individual coverage for those under 65 years old will likely be written on three-month intervals. Premiums are revised based upon claims history. A major focus is on providing supplemental insurance for patients covered by Medicare. This includes prescription drug coverage. Keep in mind that, to qualify for these plans, you must also be a member of AARP.

The daily chart shows the down-and-up patterns for bear market declines and bull market rises. The close of $293.98 on Dec. 31 was an important input to my proprietary analytics. The highest horizontal line is the annual pivot for all of 2020 at $297.29. Above the chart is the semiannual risky level for the first half of 2020 at $334.26. The lower two horizontal lines are the quarterly pivot for the first quarter at $284.22 and the monthly value level for January at $278.52.

The weekly chart for UnitedHealth is neutral, with the stock below its five-week modified moving average of $286.64 and well above its 200-week simple moving average, or "reversion to the mean," at $212.98. The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to slip to 87.40 this week, down from 91.11. This reading was above 90.00, putting the stock in an "inflating parabolic bubble" formation.

How to use my value levels and risky levels: The closing prices of stocks on Dec. 31, 2019, were inputs to my proprietary analytics and resulted in new monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual levels. Each calculation uses the last nine closes in these time horizons. New weekly levels are calculated after the end of each week. New monthly levels occur after the close of each month. New quarterly levels occur at the end of each quarter. Semiannual levels are updated at mid-year. Annual levels are in play all year long.

My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price volatility, investors should buy on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before their time horizon expires.

How to use 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings: My choice of using 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon backtesting many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years.

The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows, and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading, and I found that the slow reading worked the best.

The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00, with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold. A reading above 90.00 is considered an "inflating parabolic bubble" formation, which is typically followed by a decline of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months. A reading below 10.00 is considered "too cheap to ignore," which typically is followed by gains of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months.
