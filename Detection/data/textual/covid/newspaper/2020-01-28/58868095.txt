Health chief: no plans to declare public health emergency over coronavirus 
 The Department of Health and Human Services has no current plans to declare a public health emergency over the Wuhan coronavirus, the agency’s chief said Tuesday.

HHS Secretary Alex Azar told reporters the risk to Americans is low, and public health officials have not determined that there’s a need for such a declaration.

“I won’t hesitate at all to invoke any authorities I need to, to ensure we’re taking all steps to protect the American people, but I’ll do it when it’s appropriate,” Azar said.

Some congressional Republicans, including Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Rep. Vern Buchanan Vernon Gale BuchananMORE (R-Fla.) have called for a public health emergency declaration in order to free up additional federal funding.

Azar noted that there are still only five confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States, with no person-to-person transmission. That means that every person with a confirmed case has traveled to Wuhan, China, where the outbreak originated.

“This is potentially a very serious public health threat, but at this time Americans should not worry about their own safety,” Azar said.

At the same time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expanding its efforts to screen incoming travelers for cases of the coronavirus.

Screenings will now occur in 20 airports across the country, officials said.
