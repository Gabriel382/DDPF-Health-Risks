Gold eases back from a more than 6-year high as traders assess China virus outbreak 
 Gold futures edged lower Tuesday, as investor worries over the spread of China’s coronavirus abated somewhat and prices consolidated, a day after prices rose to a more than six-year high.

Analysts, however, said gold and other havens remain likely to see support on adverse developments regarding the outbreak.

Gold for February delivery GCG20, -0.28%  on Comex fell $1.30, or 0.08%, to $1,576.10 an ounce, while March silver SIH20, -2.17%  was off 30.6 cents, or 1.7%, at $17.75 an ounce. Gold on Monday saw the highest close for a most-active contract since April 9, 2013, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

U.S. benchmark stock indexes moved higher on Wall Street Tuesday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.46%  and S&P 500 index SPX, +0.73%  suffered their biggest one-day declines since October on fears the coronavirus outbreak could undercut global growth.

Analysts said gold’s haven-like behavior was encouraging, noting that the metal at times has seen its appeal blunted during periods of panic selling in equities and other risky assets.

“We like that there has been no sign of the ‘throwing-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater’ selling in gold that happened during some other equity market corrections. People on those occasions were taking profits after a rally in gold to pay for margin calls in other weak positions,” said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, in a note. “This time, so far at least, they are holding on to gold.”

Gold remained slightly lower after data showed orders for durable goods surged 2.4% in December, thanks to military purchases, while business investment in the civilian part of the economy declined again.

Meanwhile, March copper HGH20, -0.39%  fell 1.6 cents, or 0.6%, to $2.5805 a pound, after suffering a loss of 3.3% on Monday.

“The pace of the drop in copper prices is a growing concern as futures are down more than 10% from the January highs and beginning to suggest that there are more underlying negative influences on risk assets than just the coronavirus,” analysts at Sevens Report Research wrote in Tuesday’s newsletter.

In other metals trading, April platinum PLJ20, +0.40%  traded flat at $991.70 an ounce, while March palladium PAH20, -0.85%  was off $10.60, or 0.5%, to $2,163 an ounce.

In a report released Tuesday, analysts at Heraeus Precious Metals said they expect the “structural shortage of palladium” to continue to exist this year.

“Even if vehicle sales will decline, the higher catalyst loading in gasoline engines should more than compensate for the expected decline,” they said, with stricter exhaust emission standards in China and India indicating a higher demand for palladium. They expect prices for palladium to range between $1,800 and $2,800 in 2020.

Platinum, however, is expected to see a continued surplus this year, but a “slight increase in demand for use in oil refineries and higher demand for platinum as a catalyst metrical for chemical processes will be a ray of hope,” the Heraeus analysts said. They expect to see a platinum price range of $800 to $1,050 this year.
