 Sikkim chief secretary S C Gupta on Tuesday reviewed the preparedness of the Health and other departments to deal with coronavirus in the state.

He urged the heads of various departments and other stakeholders to remain alert and work in close coordination with each other to deal with any suspected case of coronavirus.

Gupta also sought to know all the preventive measures taken by health and other departments to deal with the disease.

The Director General (DG)-cum-Principal Director (Health) Dr P T Bhutia apprised about all precautionary measures taken by the Health Department, particularly in border areas of Rangpo and Singtam, and parts of West Sikkim.
