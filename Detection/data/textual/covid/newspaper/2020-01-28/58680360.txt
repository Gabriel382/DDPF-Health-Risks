US upgrades travel advice to China to highest level


The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has upgraded its warning for novel coronavirus to Level 3, which is to avoid all non-essential travel. This means the outbreak is of “high risk to travellers and no precautions are available to protect against the identified increased risk”.

It warns of person-to-person transmission and that “older adults and people with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe disease”. The advice also notes that there is “limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas” in China. 

Level 3 is the US’s highest warning level.
