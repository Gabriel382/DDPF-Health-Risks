Salesforce vs. Adobe is shaping up to be a big tech rivalry, Jim Cramer says 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday said Salesforce and Adobe may "become one of the great rivalries in tech."

"Lately both companies have been encroaching on each other's turf," the "Mad Money" host said. "They used to be companies with specific products. Now they offer entire platforms for small and medium-sized businesses, and that increasingly puts them in competition."

Adobe got its start as a publishing and design software company. In recent years, Adobe jumped into the software-as-a-service business with its sights set on helping firms with their digital-commerce operations. The company sells a suite of creativity, design, marketing, analytics and business solutions products.

Salesforce was founded more than a decade after Adobe was launched. The customer-relationship management service provider also markets a platform of enterprise applications for marketing, sales, service and other business matters through Salesforce Customer 360.

"As this market sells off ... on the coronavirus outbreak, let's just pray that Adobe and Salesforce get sacked so that you can buy one of them into weakness, because these are both phenomenal players," Cramer said.

Salesforce and Adobe shares both dropped in Monday's session as investors sold off stocks in fear of the spreading coronavirus. Salesforce was down almost 0.80% to $180.71 at the close, while Adobe fell nearly 1.3% to $346.90 per share.
