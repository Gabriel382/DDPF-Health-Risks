Coronavirus spreads as first patients who didn't visit Wuhan contract killer bug 
 Signs that the coronavirus outbreak is spreading globally have emerged as Japan and Germany confirmed the first cases involving patients who didn't visit the epicentre in China.

A Japanese tour bus driver contracted the SARS-like virus while ferrying Chinese holidaymakers who were visiting from Wuhan earlier this month.

In the first confirmed case in Germany, a man living near Munich was believed to have been infected there by a Chinese colleague.

The flu-like illness has killed at least 106 people and infected more than 4,500 others in China, with most of the cases in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province.

It is thought that the virus was passed to humans late last month at a market in Wuhan that sold live animals, seafood and illegal wildlife.

Most cases reported around the world so far have involved patients who had recently visited Hubei.

No cases have been confirmed in Britain, although Public Health England warned that the virus is likely already here.

Britain is urgently exploring options to for its citizens to leave Wuhan and is finalising details of the plan, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.

The Downing Street spokesman said: "The FCO [Foreign Office] is urgently exploring options for British nationals to leave Hubei province.

"Details are being finalised and the FCO will confirm these as soon as they can."
