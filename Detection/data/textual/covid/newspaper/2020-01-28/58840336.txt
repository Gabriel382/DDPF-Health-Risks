Dow opens higher after biggest one-day loss since October 
 U.S stocks recovered some ground early Tuesday, a day after growing worries about the impact of China’s coronavirus outbreak on global economic growth sparked the biggest one-day selloff since early October.

Investors were also wading through a tide of quarterly results from a number of high-profile companies as earnings reporting season picks up steam.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.47%  was up 53 points, or 0.2%, to 28,583 while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.74%   gained 10 points, or 0.3%, to 3,253. The Nasdaq-100 COMP, +0.84%   rose 45 points or 0.5%, to 9,187.

The Dow dropped 453.93 points Tuesday, a decline of 1.6%, to end at 28,535.80, while the S&P 500 shed 51.84 points, or 1.6%, to end at 3,243.63. It was the biggest decline for both indexes since Oct. 2. The Nasdaq Composite ended at 9,139.31, down 175.60 points or 1.9% — its biggest-one day fall since Aug. 23.

“The virus-related uncertainty that plagued global markets in recent days started to abate on Tuesday,” with stock-index futures pointing to a slightly higher start and the Japanese yen, a traditional have, unable to extend recent gains, said Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at XM, in a note.

“Admittedly though, this recovery in sentiment seems fragile at best, considering that American stocks fell by nearly 1.6% yesterday and that the yen is still substantially higher this week,” Hadjikyriacos said.

Chinese authorities on Tuesday said deaths from the viral disease rose by 25 to at least 106, while the number of confirmed cases in China rose to 4,515.

China’s already weakening economy is set to take another hit with businesses across the country remaining shut for an extended public holiday and tourism grinding to a halt, as authorities struggle to contain the pneumonia-like coronavirus that has spread across the nation, the South China Morning Post reported.

In U.S. economic data, December durable goods orders surged 2.4% in December owing to military purchases, but business investment in the civilian part of the economy declined again to finish the year on a weak note. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast a 0.3% decline in orders. Excluding defence spending durable goods orders sank 2.5% and the government revised orders for November to show an even bigger 3.1% drop. The weakness in orders and business investment could be a drag on the economy in 2020 unless it turns around.

Dow component, United Technologies Corp. UTX, +0.58%, fell 1.2% on opening even though after it reported profit and sales that beat estimates.

Pfizer Inc. PFE, -3.40%  shares were down 2.9% early after the drugmaker reported profit that missed expectations, while revenue rose in line with forecasts.
