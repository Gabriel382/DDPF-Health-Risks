Filipinos from coronavirus-hit countries can be quarantined in an island–senators 
 MANILA, Philippines—Filipinos returning  from countries reportedly hit by novel coronavirus could be placed in an island for a 21-day quarantine, senators recommended on Tuesday.

Senator Imee Marcos first floated the idea during the hearing of the Senate committee on labor, which was later backed by the panel head, Senator Joel Villanueva.

Marcos recalled that when the outbreak of ebola virus affected West Africa in 2014, Filipino peacekeepers from Liberia were  quarantined in Caballo Island for 21 days.

The same, she said, may be considered for Filipinos who would be returning from China and even from other countries not hit by the coronavirus.

“Narinig ko may 30 na taga Wuhan na Filipino na nais nang umuwi, pero ‘pag isipin mo you’re going to bring them, evacuate them in order to bring the virus over here. Syempre ayaw nating mangyari…”  Marcos said.

Wuhan is a city in China where the virus was first detected and infected people since December last year. Based on report, the virus has already killed over 100 people and infected thousands others.

“I think until now, our best option is simply to tell them to follow their protocols in China and observe the lockdown. Wala namang choice [There is no other choice],” Marcos went on.

Besides, Marcos noted that China has already imposed a lockdown, preventing anyone from going in and out of the country to  prevent the spread of the new virus.

“Siguro yun din ang kailangang pag-isipan kung saan dadalhin ang mga ito. Hindi naman pwedeng dalhin direktamente dito sa Pilipinas, sa Maynila halimbawa or a highly populated place where they will simply infect and spread the virus,” she said.
