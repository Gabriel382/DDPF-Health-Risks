Two college hoops games PPD amid virus fears 
 Miami University (Ohio) has postponed their next men's and women's basketball games on the heels of news that two Miami students are being investigated for the coronavirus.
The men's team was scheduled to play Central Michigan at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday while the women's were slated to play Western Michigan on Wednesday night. The games will be rescheduled at a later date.
According to a statement from Miami, a student who had recently returned from China showed mild symptoms and met the criteria to be tested for the coronavirus. Health officials are expecting results of the tests later in the week.
In the meantime, the student and their traveling partner are being isolated in their off-campus homes. While they are not sick enough to have been hospitalized, as a precaution, they have been kept from contact with other people.
Central Michigan athletics director Michael Alford released a statement Tuesday, but did not specifically state that the games were being canceled because of the potential of the coronavirus.
"The health and safety of our student-athletes is always a top priority and, out of an ounce of caution, it was decided to cancel tonight's men's basketball game," Alford said. "I appreciate the diligence that the staff at Miami have shown and this serves as a reminder of how serious these issues are. Our medical team has also been an important part of this process, making sure our student-athletes are safe and protected."
While Miami officials do not know for sure if the concerns over the virus are the reason for the cancellation, university president Gregory Crawford spoke at a news conference Tuesday and said the cancellation was initiated by both Central Michigan and Western Michigan, who went through the MAC Commissioner's office and the athletic directors.
