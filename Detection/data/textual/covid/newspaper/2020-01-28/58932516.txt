CDOT: Avoid I-225 southbound during Tuesday rush hour 
 A crash on Interstate 225 southbound near Iliff Avenue has closed the interstate and motorists should avoid the highway during Tuesday’s evening rush hour.
Traffic along southbound I-225 is being diverted off the highway at 6th Avenue, according to a news release from the Colorado Department of Transportation.
However, CDOT and the Aurora Police Department are asking commuters to find an alternate route home because secondary roads such as 6th Avenue are not designed to handle such a heavy volume of traffic.
The crash investigation and clean up is expected to last through the rush hour, CDOT said.
