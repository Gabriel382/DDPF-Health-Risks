 In a Tuesday statement, China’s embassy in Denmark demanded an apology from the Jyllands-Posten newspaper and Danish cartoonist Niels Bo Bojesen for publishing the cartoon.

Jyllands-Posten Editor-in-Chief Jacob Nybroe said in a statement Tuesday that the newspaper did not intend to joke about the deadly virus, but it would not issue an apology.

“We cannot apologize for something that we don’t believe is wrong,” Nybroe is quoted as telling local newswire Ritzau. “We have no intention of demeaning or mocking the situation in China, and we don’t think the drawing does that.”

In addition, Danish Justice Minister Søren Pape Poulsen expressed his support of the paper’s publication Tuesday through a tweet.

The coronavirus, which is officially known as 2019-nCoV, first began spreading in the central Chinese city of Wuhan some time between December 12 and December 29. So far, official estimates state that number of coronavirus cases registered across China as of Monday night is 4,515, while the number of deaths is at least 81. However, a Hong Kong scientist warned Tuesday that the total number of infected people across China may actually be as high as 44,000. Some coronavirus cases have also been registered in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Australia, France, Germany, Canada and the United States.
