Coronavirus Live Updates: Japan Warns About Risks to Economy From Outbreak 
 Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura warned on Tuesday that corporate profits and factory production might take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak in China that has rattled global markets and chilled confidence.

Asian stocks extended a global selloff as the outbreak in China fueled concern over the damage to the world’s second largest economy.

“There are concerns over the impact to the global economy from the spread of infection in China, transportation disruptions, cancellation of group tours from China and an extension in the Lunar Holiday,” Nishimura told a news conference after a regular cabinet meeting.

“If the situation takes longer to subside, we’re concerned it could hurt Japanese exports, output, and corporate profits via the impact on Chinese consumption and production,” he said.

China is Japan’s second largest export destination and a huge market for its retailers. The Chinese make up 30 percent of all tourists visiting Japan and nearly 40 percent of the total sum foreign tourists spent last year, an industry survey showed.

The outbreak could hit Japanese department stores, retailers, and hotels, which count on a boost to sales from an inflow of Chinese tourists visiting during the Lunar Holiday.

“We’re worried that sales and the number of shoppers could fall if the outbreak persists,” said a public relations official at Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings, a major Japanese department store operator.

“It’s not just about Chinese tourists. We’re also worried that concern over the outbreak may keep Japanese shoppers home.”
