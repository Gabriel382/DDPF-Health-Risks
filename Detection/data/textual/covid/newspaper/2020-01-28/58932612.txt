Apple rises as earnings and iPhone sales smash expectations 
 Apple reported revenue and profit significantly higher than what Wall Street analysts expected and spiked as much as 3% before settling down up around 1% in after-hours trading.

Apple's revenue was up 9% to $91.8 billion, which beat its own guidance. That's a significant change from the same quarter last year when it had to revise its revenue guidance down mid-quarter based on weakness in China.

Apple's earnings were partially powered by iPhone revenue, which was up 8% on the strength of new iPhone models to $55.96 billion.

"It was sort of a blockbuster quarter all the way around," Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Josh Lipton.

Here's how Apple did compared to Refinitiv consensus estimates:

However, Apple's range of guidance for next quarter is wider than typical, a change that Cook attributed to uncertainty caused by the deadly coronavirus, which has shut down travel in parts of China.

"As you can see from the range, anticipates some level of issue there. Otherwise, we would not have a $4 billion range," Cook said.

Cook said that Apple's "Greater China" segment, which also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, had returned to growth in the quarter, which ended in December.

Investors in recent months have turned more attention on Apple's "Other Products" category, which includes Apple Watch and AirPods, two products that Apple said it could not make enough of during the quarter. Cook said that there is still more demand than supply for the $199 Apple Watch Series 3 and the $249 AirPods Pro.
