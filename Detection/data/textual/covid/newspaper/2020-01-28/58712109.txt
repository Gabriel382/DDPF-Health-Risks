Coronavirus: China death toll passes 100 as Beijing records its first fatality 
 The new strain of coronavirus spreading across China claimed its first victim in Beijing, officials said on Tuesday, as the death toll jumped to 106.

While the UK embarked on a desperate scramble to return 200 British nationals stranded in Wuhan, the United States, Japan other nations also raced to get their citizens out of Wuhan, the locked-down Chinese city at ground zero of a virus epidemic.

Expanding its massive effort to contain the viral outbreak, China urged its citizens to postpone trips abroad.

The recommendation to delay non-essential travel was issued "in order to protect the health and safety of Chinese and foreign people", the National Immigration Administration said in a statement.

"Reducing people's cross-border movement helps to prevent and control outbreaks," the agency added.
