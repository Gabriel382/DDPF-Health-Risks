Korean Stocks Fall amid Fears of Coronavirus 
 The Korea Composite Stock Price Index plunged Tuesday by three percent to close at 2,176 points, marking the sharpest fall in 15 months.

Stocks were down across Asia, including Japan, after Wall Street fell overnight amid fears the coronavirus outbreak could hurt China's economic growth and the global travel industry.

The governor of the Bank of Korea has called for forming a special task force to monitor financial markets 24/7 and share information with the government.

At an economy-related ministers' meeting on Tuesday, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said the government will spend around US$18 million of emergency funds set aside for tackling epidemics for this year's budget for quarantine operations and treatment.

He added the government will take cues from past cases, including SARS in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS, in 2015 to address the possible economic impact on Korea's tourism and services sectors.
