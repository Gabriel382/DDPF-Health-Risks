Germany confirms three further cases of coronavirus | DW | 28.01.2020 
 The German Health Ministry confirmed late on Tuesday that three further cases of thenew dangerous strain of coronavirus have been discovered in Bavaria, increasing the total numer of patients in Germany to four. The three new patients were "connected" to the first found in Germany, which had been verified on Monday.

Health officials said that the first person had contracted the disease from a Chinese colleague who had visited the area for a company workshop a week ago. Because the incubation period is believed to be unusually long — at up to two weeks — it is possible that the colleague had no symptoms at the time.

"There were a total of around 40 employees who have been determined to have been in contact with the [Chinese] woman. Those affected will be tested on Wednesday as a precaution."

The company in question was named as Webasto, which develops motor vehicle products, and is based near the Bavarian town of Starnberg.

The first patient was considered to be in a "medicially good state," officials said, adding that the risk of infection for people in Bavaria remained low.
