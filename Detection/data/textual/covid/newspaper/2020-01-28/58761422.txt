	As construction workers race against time to build two special hospitals in Wuhan, the center of the novel coronavirus outbreak, tens of millions of people around the country are watching the construction through a live streaming broadcast.


	At 4:30 pm on Tuesday, about 10 million people were watching the ongoing construction of the Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals - two makeshift hospitals for novel coronavirus patients in suburban Wuhan.


	Live-stream cameras have been installed at the hospital construction sites. In the live streaming video, people can see a bird's-eye view of the construction site, with workers, trucks and excavators racing to make the deadline.


	Wuhan government announced on Friday that it would build for designated patients a 1,000-bed mobile hospital, named Huoshenshan, with a floor area of 25,000 square meters, before Feb 3.


	On Saturday, the city announced a plan to build a 1,300-bed hospital, named Leishenshan, to receive patients to ease the shortage of beds in the city.


	Stuck at home due to the disease, many people have been following the news related to the virus through the internet. The construction of the two hospitals also has attracted tens of millions of "volunteer supervisors", as netizens call themselves. Viewers are exchanging their stories and feelings in the difficult time, in addition to talking about the construction projects.


	"I'm from Guangdong. I'm one of the online construction supervisors," a netizen wrote in a comment under the streaming video.


	"Best wishes to Wuhan people, and good luck to all of us," another viewer wrote in the comments.
