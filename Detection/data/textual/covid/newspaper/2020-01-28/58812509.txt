Hong Kong to close borders with mainland China as global alarm spreads over coronavirus 
 Hong Kong said on Tuesday it would “temporarily” close some of its borders with mainland China and stop issuing travel permits to Chinese tourists as the death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus jumped to 107 and reached at least 14 foreign countries.

The drastic move to halt high speed rail links from Jan 30, cut flights from China by half and suspend cross-border ferry services joined a chorus of alarm around the world at the rapid spread of the virus, which is a similar pathogen to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which killed 800 globally in 2003.

Memories of SARS are particularly raw in Hong Kong, a densely populated city, where 1,750 were infected and more than 280 died during the SARS outbreak. So far, the city has reported eight infections from the new Wuhan strain.

Carrie Lam, the city’s embattled chief executive, whose popularity is already at an all-time low from eight months of pro-democracy protests, eventually buckled to widespread political pressure and public demands to limit transit from the mainland.

The announcement comes after the number of infections in China soared overnight by nearly 60 per cent to more than 4,500.
