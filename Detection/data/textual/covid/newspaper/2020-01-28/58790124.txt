Honda to extend China motorcycle output halt amid virus outbreak 
 TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Honda Motor Co. said Tuesday it will extend an output suspension at two motorcycle plants in China until Feb. 8 in response to requests from local authorities following a deadly coronavirus outbreak.

The Japanese automaker said output at the two plants in Tianjin and Taicang was previously scheduled to be suspended through Feb. 2 after the Chinese government extended the Lunar New Year holiday.

Honda now plans to restart the factories operated by Sundiro Honda Motorcycle Co., a joint venture headquartered in Shanghai, on Feb. 9, instead of the previously set date of Feb. 3.

The Tianjin and Taicang plants have an annual production capacity of 350,000 and 500,000 units, respectively, and account for around 40 percent of Honda's total motorcycle output in China.

The Japanese company also has three plants producing four-wheel vehicles in Wuhan, the center of the virus outbreak, with a total annual capacity of 600,000 vehicles.

The automaker has canceled its planned restart of the plants on Feb. 3 and has yet to set a new date.
