'No new bad news': Wall St rebounds ahead of Apple earnings 
 Growing unease towards China’s coronavirus outbreak saw Australian consumer confidence hold near decade lows last week, offsetting the impact of the long weekend and news that Australia’s unemployment rate fell to nine-month lows in December.
The weekly ANZ Bank-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index slipped 0.3 per cent to 108.0, remaining below the average of 113.1 seen since 1990.
“The news flow around the coronavirus and the potential implications for Chinese and Australian growth likely acted as a material offset to the more positive local news,” ANZ Bank head of Australian economics David Plank said. There are a number of unusual influences on sentiment at present, such as the bushfires and coronavirus and the offsetting impact of strength in the labour market. This makes it more difficult than usual to assess how consumer spending will respond.”
Mr Plank believes this heighten degree of uncertainty will see the RBA hold off lowering interest rates again next week.
“We think this difficulty will see the RBA opting to wait for more information before it considers a further reduction in the cash rate,” he said.
By component, sentiment towards current economic conditions, current finances and household spending all declined. Views towards longer-term economic conditions improved while those towards finances in the year ahead were unchanged.
