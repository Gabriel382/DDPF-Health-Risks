Foreign Office warns against all but essential travel to China over coronavirus 
 The Foreign Office has warned Brits from travelling to China on all but the most essential trips as fears around the coronavirus grow.

British people who are in China have been told to make decisions as to whether to head back to the UK now based on 'their own personal circumstances'.

Entry back into the UK from China may 'become more difficult in the coming days', the Foreign Office has warned.

Commercial flights out of China are still running, except in the Hubei Province which contains the epicentre of the viral outbreak Wuhan.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: "Due to the increasing travel restrictions and the public health situation, we now advise against all but essential travel to China.

"We are also working urgently to finalise arrangements for an assisted departure from Hubei Province for British nationals this week, and are in contact with people in Hubei to ensure they register their interest and that we can keep them updated.

"The UK continues to be guided by the latest medical advice about the coronavirus outbreak. The safety and security of British people will always be our top priority."

The Foreign Office advice refers to mainland China, which means Hong Kong and Macau are excluded.

All Brits left stranded in the coronavirus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan are expected to be flown home as early as Thursday.

People are being urged to contact the British consulate before 11am on Wednesday if they wish to leave.

The news comes as almost 100 people in the UK have tested negative for coronavirus.

The Department of Health and Social Care said 97 people have been given the all-clear for the virus, although scientists predict it may have entered the country.

Earlier today the world wide death toll stood at 106, with more than 4,500 infected.
