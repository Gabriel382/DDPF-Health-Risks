Health experts call for calm as coronavirus cases rise 
 The spread of the coronavirus is causing concern for members of the public and global financial markets, but health experts are keen to put the virus into context.

Chinese health authorities said Tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak has killed 106 people and infected 4,515. The officials also said 60 people had been discharged.

While the death toll is expected to continue to rise, and the virus to spread (Germany confirmed its first case on Monday, the second European nation to do so after France) most of the cases are so far contained to China and the authorities have put in measures to try to stop the spread, including quarantining several major cities and canceling Lunar New Year's events in Beijing and elsewhere.

China's reaction to the health crisis is among the reasons why we shouldn't panic about the virus, experts say.

"It appears to be very well contained," Mark Parrish, regional medical director of Northern Europe at International SOS, told CNBC Tuesday.

"The Chinese have done some extraordinary things, identifying the virus and its molecular structures and then instigating those quarantine measures in China where they have shut down these huge cities and stopped all movement. It's come at a really bad time of the year ... It's likely to have moved around China."

"It appears though that the death rate remains at about 2% to 3%, it seems to be very well contained at the moment," he said.

"Putting it into perspective, 100 deaths or so, so far, all in elderly people and those that have other co-existing diseases unfortunately. And those are the ones that are most likely to be affected by this as their respiratory systems find it difficult to deal with these things."
