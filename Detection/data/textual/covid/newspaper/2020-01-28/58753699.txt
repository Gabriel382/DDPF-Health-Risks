South Korean Won 
 The Korean won lost 0.7% to 1,178.2 per US dollar on Tuesday, its lowest level since December 12th, 2019, as investors worry that the new coronavirus outbreak could hurt the economy which is highly exposed to China, the biggest buyer of South Korean goods. The death toll from the virus rose to 106 people in China, with more than 4,500 cases of the illness being confirmed across the globe.

Historically, the South Korean Won reached an all time high of 2388.36 in September of 2019.

The South Korean Won is expected to trade at 1173.35 by the end of this quarter, according to Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations. Looking forward, we estimate it to trade at 1191.80 in 12 months time.
