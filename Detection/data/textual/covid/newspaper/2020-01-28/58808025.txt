iPhone 12 leak suggests Apple could launch four models including 'iPhone Mini' 
 It’s only been four months since Apple launched its 2019 iPhones, but keen fans are already looking ahead to its 2020  smartphone lineup.

Now, a report by LetsGoDigital claims that Apple could launch not just one, but four new iPhone models this September.

LetsGoDigital said: “The Apple phones that appear in the fall must replace the current iPhone 11 series. Instead of three models, the series of models in 2020 seems to consist of four different devices.”

The smallest model is reported to be called the iPhone 12 Mini, and features a 5.4-inch OLED screen, as well as a dual-lens rear camera.

Meanwhile, Apple could launch two smartphones with 6.1-inch displays - the iPhone 12 with a dual-lens camera, and the iPhone 12 Pro with a triple-lens camera.

Finally, LetsGoDigital indicates that Apple will launch a 6.7-inch model with a triple-lens camera, called the iPhone 12 Pro Max.

While that’s pretty huge, LetsGoDigital suggests that Apple may reduce the screen edges to ensure the iPhone 12 Pro Max can still fit in your hand.

It added: “By further reducing the screen edges, a slightly larger display surface can be integrated, without the overall dimensions becoming significantly larger, so that the phone can still be operated with one hand.

“It would also be the first time that Apple only uses OLED panels, at least for the 12-series, because the SE 2 still gets an LCD screen.”

While Apple usually launches its smartphones in September, rumours suggest that it could release a budget version of the iPhone 11 in March.

However, a report by Nikkei Asian Review indicates that the coronavirus outbreak could force Apple to delay the launch of this budget iPhone.
