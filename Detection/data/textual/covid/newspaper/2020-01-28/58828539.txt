Chartered Plane Off to Wuhan to Bring Japanese Home - JIJI PRESS 
 Tokyo, Jan. 28 (Jiji Press)--An All Nippon Airways airplane chartered by the Japanese government left Tokyo International Airport at Haneda on Tuesday night to bring home Japanese nationals in Wuhan following the spread of a deadly coronavirus that caused pneumonia in China. 

    The plane will ferry some 200 people hoping to return home, who will be the first group of Japanese to be evacuated from the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak using government-chartered aircraft.

    The ANA plane will depart from a Wuhan airport in the small hours of Wednesday and arrive back at Haneda later in the morning. As of Tuesday, a total of some 650 Japanese nationals in Wuhan wished to return to Japan, according to the government.

    The government plans to dispatch additional chartered aircraft on or after Wednesday to pull the remaining people out of the Chinese city. It is also considering sending government aircraft for the evacuation.

    It is believed to be the first time for the government to use a chartered flight to rescue Japanese nationals from abroad because of an infectious disease outbreak.
