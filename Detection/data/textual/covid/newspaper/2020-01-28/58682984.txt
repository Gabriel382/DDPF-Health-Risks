Korea Confirms 4th Case of Coronavirus 
 Korea reported its fourth case of coronavirus infection on Monday. Health authorities said that the 55-year-old Korean man arrived here on Jan. 20 after visiting the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.

Only on Sunday Korea had reported its third case, a 54-year-old Korean male who used to live in Wuhan.

Around 2,900 cases of coronavirus infection have been reported around the world so far, and at least 81 have died.

Unlike the first two cases of infection, the two men had moved around southern Seoul and Goyang north of the capital for more than five days, raising fears that they spread the highly infectious virus. The third victim had come ino into contact with at least 74 people since he arrived here on Jan. 20, staying in a hotel in Gangnam and visiting a department store and supermarket in Goyang.
