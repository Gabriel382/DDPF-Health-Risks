Dow rebounds after biggest one-day loss since October 
 U.S stocks recovered some ground Tuesday, a day after worries about the impact of China’s coronavirus outbreak on global economic growth sparked the biggest one-day selloff since early October.

Investors were also wading through a tide of quarterly results from a number of high-profile companies as earnings reporting season picks up steam.

At midsession the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.77%  gained 216 points, or 0.8%, to 28,752 while the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.02%  was up 33 points, or 1%, to 3,277. The Nasdaq-100 COMP, +1.36%   rose 122 points or 1.3%, to 9,262.

The Dow dropped 453.93 points Tuesday, a decline of 1.6%, to end at 28,535.80, while the S&P 500 shed 51.84 points, or 1.6%, to end at 3,243.63. It was the biggest decline for both indexes since Oct. 2. The Nasdaq Composite ended at 9,139.31, down 175.60 points or 1.9% — its biggest-one day fall since Aug. 23.

Chinese authorities on Tuesday said deaths from the coronavirus epidemic rose to at least 106, while the number of confirmed cases in China rose to more than 4,500.

China’s already weakening economy is set to take another hit with businesses across the country remaining shut for an extended public holiday and tourism grinding to a halt, as authorities struggle to contain the pneumonia-like coronavirus that has spread across the nation, the South China Morning Post reported.

“While the coronavirus outbreak is an unexpected risk factor that could move the markets if the situation deteriorates, and comparisons to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been widespread, there are important differences,” J.P. Morgan, chief of global research, Joyce Chang wrote in a note.

“First, the Chinese government has taken serious actions much faster this time. Second, the mortality rate of the current coronavirus outbreak is 2-3% compared to +10% for SARS, and the vast majority of current casualties have been concentrated in elderly people with pre-existing conditions,” Chang said.

Investors are also digesting U.S. corporate earnings reports Tuesday. Apple is among the S&P 500 index components set to report after Tuesday’s close. Apple suppliers cautioned coronavirus could impact the phonemaker’s planned production hike.

“Companies are beating earnings estimates by 5% thus far, the best beat rate since 1Q19, a number in line with the post-crisis median but the best beat rate since 1Q19,” Morgan Stanley, equity strategist, Michael Wilson wrote.

But “there is a major gap between earnings revisions and year on year performance suggesting continued positive earnings momentum is needed to help support price momentum,” he said.

In U.S. economic data, December durable goods orders surged 2.4% in December owing to military purchases, but business investment in the civilian part of the economy declined again to finish the year on a weak note. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast a 0.3% decline in orders. Excluding defence spending durable goods orders sank 2.5% and the government revised orders for November to show an even bigger 3.1% drop. The weakness in orders and business investment could be a drag on the economy in 2020 unless it turns around.

The U.S. S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city house price index increased 2.6% in November versus a year ago. At the national level, home prices were up on an annual basis by 3.5%, representing a faster rate of home-price appreciation than was recorded in October.

Meanwhile, U.S consumer confidence was running high at the start of 2020, hitting its highest level in five months. The Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence climbed to 131.6 in January from a revised 128.2 in the prior month.

Apple AAPL, +2.39%  was up 2.5% midday ahead of its earnings report after the market close Tuesday.

Dow component, United Technologies Corp. UTX, +2.03%, was up 2% after it reported profit and sales that beat estimates.

Pfizer Inc. PFE, -5.20%  shares were down 4% after the drugmaker reported profit that missed expectations, while revenue rose in line with forecasts.
