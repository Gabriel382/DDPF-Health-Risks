Foreign Office warns Britons not to travel to China amid coronavirus crisis 
 The government has warned UK residents against travelling to mainland China as fears over the fatal coronavirus continue to grow.

On Tuesday, the Foreign Office updated its travel advice to advise against all but essential travel to the mainland, in a bid top stop the fatal virus from spreading.

More than 100 people have died from the new strain of the virus, which broke out in the central city of Wuhan after people picked it up from a fresh food market.

The foreign travel advice for China on the gov.uk website has been updated to say: ‘The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Hubei Province due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.

‘If you’re in this area and able to leave, you should do so.

‘The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China (not including Hong Kong and Macao).

‘The Chinese government continue to impose further restrictions on movement within China in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

‘It may become harder over the coming weeks for those who wish to leave China to do so.

‘If you feel that you may want to leave China soon, you should consider making plans to do so before any further restrictions may be imposed.’
