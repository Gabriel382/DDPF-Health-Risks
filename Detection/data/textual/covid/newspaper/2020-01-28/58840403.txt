Warren announces infectious-disease plan amid coronavirus outbreak 
 Elizabeth Warren says she’s “got a plan” to combat infectious diseases, like coronavirus, that includes fully funding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and pumping $100 billion into the National Institutes of Health.

The Massachusetts senator and 2020 hopeful unveiled her comprehensive plan — and took a swipe at Trump — on Tuesday as the deadly coronavirus continues to sweep China.

“Like so much else, Trump’s approach to keeping us safe from disease outbreaks is a mess,” she said on her website. “But when he’s gone, we can fix it.”

Warren vowed to fully fund the CDC’s pandemic prevention and response programs and push the agency to develop vaccines against infectious diseases, including a universal immunization against the flu. The CDC has faced major budget cuts under the Trump administration.

The Democratic candidate said some of the proposed funding for the NIH will come from a “‘swear jar’ where companies will pay a portion of their profits from publicly-funded research back to the NIH.”

She said her Medicare for All plan would help combat the spread of disease by ensuring everyone has access to affordable health care.

The coronavirus has killed some 100 people across China and has been detected in five patients in the US.

“Diseases like coronavirus remind us why we need robust international institutions, strong investments in public health, and a government that is prepared to jump into action at a moment’s notice,” Warren wrote. “When we prepare and effectively collaborate to address common threats that don’t stop at borders, the international community can stop these diseases in their tracks.”

Warren has earned a reputation for having “a plan” for every issue. Her latest comes just days before the Iowa caucuses and as the senator looks to boost her third-place standing in national polls, behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
