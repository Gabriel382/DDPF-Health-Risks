The recent outbreak of the corona virus resulted in dismal performances for the traditional assets, but crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum reacted differently. Eighteen of the Top Twenty tokens saw their prices rise, and analysts say that the behavior resembles that of gold, a safe asset that just hit a new three-week high of $1581.90. SP500 closed down by 1.6% on Monday, its sharpest decline since October 2nd.
According to the crypto disclosure platform Xangle, Ethereum’s 24H on-chain trading volume was around $189M, 69.02% higher than the previous 24 hours. Number of new wallets and transactions worth $1M+ have also increased by 60.47% and 400% respectively.
