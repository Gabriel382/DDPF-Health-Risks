“We have begun the process to prepare for evacuation of Indian nationals affected by the situation arising out of nCorona-2019 virus outbreak in Hubei province, China,” said official spokesperson Raveesh Kumar.

Wuhan is home to several hundred Indians, including students. In a press release issued on Monday, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had sought the intervention of the External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to evacuate 100 students from the State studying in the virus-hit city.
