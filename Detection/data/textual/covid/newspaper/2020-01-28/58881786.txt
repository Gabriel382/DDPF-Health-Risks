 CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:) said on Tuesday it was suspending some flights between the United States and Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai between Feb. 1 and Feb. 8 due to a "significant decline in demand" as the new coronavirus spreads.
 "We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops and will adjust our schedule as needed," United said in a statement.
 The coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China has killed 106 people in the Asian country and spread across the world, rattling financial markets.
 United's suspension affects a total of 24 flights.
 
The other two U.S. airlines that fly to China, Delta Air Lines Inc (N:) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:), said they had not reduced their flights at this time but were closely monitoring the situation.
