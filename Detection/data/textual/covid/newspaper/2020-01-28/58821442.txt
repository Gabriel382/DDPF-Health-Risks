Dow on track for higher open after biggest one-day loss since October 
 Stock-index futures pointed to a higher start for U.S. equities Tuesday, a day after growing worries about the impact of China’s coronavirus outbreak on global economic growth sparked the biggest one-day selloff since early October.

Investors were also set to wade through a tide of quarterly results from a number of high-profile companies as earnings reporting season picks up steam.

“The virus-related uncertainty that plagued global markets in recent days started to abate on Tuesday,” with stock-index futures pointing to a slightly higher start and the Japanese yen, a traditional have, unable to extend recent gains, said Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at XM, in a note.

“Admittedly though, this recovery in sentiment seems fragile at best, considering that American stocks fell by nearly 1.6% yesterday and that the yen is still substantially higher this week,” Hadjikyriacos said.

Chinese authorities on Tuesday said deaths from the viral disease rose by 25 to at least 106, while the number of confirmed cases in China rose to 4,515.

In U.S. economic data, December durable goods orders surged 2.4% in December owing to military purchases, but business investment in the civilian part of the economy declined again to finish the year on a weak note. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast a 0.3% decline in orders. Excluding defence spending durable goods orders sank 2.5% and the government revised orders for November to show an even bigger 3.1% drop. The weakness in orders and business investment could be a drag on the economy in 2020 unless it turns around.
