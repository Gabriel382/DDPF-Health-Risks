First case of coronavirus confirmed in Germany 
 Germany has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus, also marking the first case of human-to-human transmission in Europe. A 33-year-old man is believed to have been infected by a female Chinese colleague after the pair attended the same meeting in Bavaria. A few days earlier, the Shanghai woman was visited by her parents who come from the worst-affected Wuhan area. The German man is stable and receiving treatment while in isolation. Image: AP
