United Airlines cancels dozens of flights to China over coronavirus 
 United Airlines is suspending flights to China because coronavirus fears have decreased travel demand, the company announced Tuesday.

The airline will be canceling dozens of flights between Feb. 1 and Feb. 8, it said. It was not immediately clear if more cancellations would come.

United had recently began issuing travel waivers for flights to Wuhan and three other Chinese cities as reported cases of the virus spread.

The virus has now killed more than 100 people in China and sickened around 4,500 others.
