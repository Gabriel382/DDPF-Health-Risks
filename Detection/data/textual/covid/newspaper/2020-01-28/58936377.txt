Many Planes Actually Made It Out Of Wuhan Yesterday And Today 
 : The Toronto Sun reports Coronavirus control at airports is pretty much a leap of faith.

Just like that, more than 1,000 people on three flights from China walked into Canada without medical screening.

If the coronavirus happens to be incubating in any one of those passengers who arrived at Pearson International Airport’s Terminal 3 on Monday, they are now mingling with Canadian residents.

That one-word answer got him through.

As MishTalk's Mike Shedlock detailed earlier, many planes managed to get out of Wuhan over the past few days. Let's take a look as to where.

Wuhan to San Francisco 12:00-18:00 - Three Flights to San Francisco (China South, American, Delta) are listed as "Scheduled".

The huge problem with Flightstats is you have to click on every flight to see if it is scheduled, cancelled, unknown, landed, or in the air. There are thousands of flights per day from some Chinese cities.

I do not believe those SFO scheduled flight left or ever will. See Addendum.

In that article I commented "Wuhan may be locked down. The rest of China isn't yet."

This update shows it is indeed still possible to escape Wuhan, then depart from some other city to the US, Japan, Europe, or elsewhere.

This is confirmation that the US should have halted all planes from China long ago.

This Tweet From SFO Airport Official

"The flight tracking app you are looking at has not updated with the correct origin city. That flight came from Guangzhou (CAN) and not Wuhan (WUH). Flights originally were from CAN-WUH and then WUH-SFO. However flights are not stopping in WUH and going direct from CAN-SFO."

So SFO landing was really from CAN. The rest of the departures do seem to be from WUH.
