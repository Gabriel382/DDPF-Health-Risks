NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded on Tuesday, with the SP 500 recovering from its biggest one-day percentage drop in nearly four months, led by a climb in shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and other names hit by concerns of exposure to the coronavirus outbreak in China that sparked a recent sell-off. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 186.23 points, or 0.65%, to 28,722.03, the SP 500 .SPX gained 32.59 points, or 1.00%, to 3,276.22 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 130.37 points, or 1.43%, to 9,269.68.
