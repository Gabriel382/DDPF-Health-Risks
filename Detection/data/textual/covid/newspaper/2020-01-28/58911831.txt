 MONTREAL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Air Canada said on Tuesday it is canceling select flights to China to better match capacity with expected demand as the spread of the new coronavirus rattles travelers.

Air Canada currently operates 33 flights a week to China and the resulting capacity reduction is relatively small, a company spokesman said by email. Those customers who are affected will be notified and provided with alternate travel options.
