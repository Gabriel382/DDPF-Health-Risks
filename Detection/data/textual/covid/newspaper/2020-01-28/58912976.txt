AMD stock slides as outlook falls below Wall Street view 
 Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shares declined in the extended session Tuesday after the chip maker’s outlook fell below Wall Street estimates and data-center sales did not come in as well as expected.

AMD AMD, +2.58%  shares declined 2% after hours, following a 2.6% rise in the regular session to close at $50.53, after the company said it expects revenue of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion for the first quarter, while analysts had forecast revenue of $1.86 billion.

Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $2.13 billion from $1.42 billion in the year-ago period, while analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast revenue of $2.11 billion.

The sequential decline in revenue going into the first quarter “is driven primarily by negligible semi-custom revenue which continues to soften in advance of the ramp of next-generation products, in addition to seasonality,” AMD said in a statement.

While the company topped Wall Street estimates for the quarter, sales of data-center chips fell short of what analysts were expecting, a doubly disappointing outcome given better-than-expected data-center sales from larger rival Intel Corp. INTC, +2.47%  last week.

AMD reported sales of enterprise embedded and semi-custom segment, which include AMD’s Epyc line of data-center chips, came in at $465 million, while analysts had expected sales to rise 39% to $603.8 million.

In AMD’s largest segment, computing and graphics chips, the company reported sales of $1.66 billion, while analysts expected a 52% rise in sales to $1.5 billion, according to FactSet.
