Palace to study barring entry from countries with confirmed coronavirus cases 
 MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang on Tuesday said it will study whether there is a need to restrict entry of people coming from countries with confirmed coronavirus cases.

“Pag-aaralan lahat yan kasi nga bringing them here might also open to spreading the disease unnecessarily. Pag-aaralan lahat yan kung ano yung nakakabuti,” Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo said in a press briefing.

Panelo said that the Palace is also waiting for the recommendation of the Department of Health (DOH) and World Health Organization (WHO) regarding this.

There is also no need to create a task force dedicated to tackle the novel coronavirus since the DOH “is managing it well,” Panelo added.

The Bureau of Immigration (BI) earlier suspended the issuance of visa upon arrival (VUA) to Chinese nationals amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

Commissioner Jaime Morente said this directive follows the temporary lockdown of several cities in China, where the death toll has risen to 106.

Other countries which have confirmed cases are France, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, United States and Vietnam.

The DOH said there are no confirmed cases in the Philippines yet, but 11 persons are being investigated for having the virus.
