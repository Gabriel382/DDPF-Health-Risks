Officials warn of fake coronavirus alerts at GTHA universities and colleges 
 Coronavirus alerts at some Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area universities and colleges on Monday have been debunked as fakes by officials.

Ryerson University tweeted at around 5:45 p.m. Monday that “Ryerson University is aware that there are fake social media posts alleging that students have been admitted to hospital with the coronavirus today. There are no cases of coronavirus at Ryerson.”

The university said an investigation is underway and that people should check the school’s security alerts page for the latest information.

Meanwhile down the QEW in Hamilton, an image purporting to show a “quarantine notice” at a student residence at McMaster University was also shot down by officials.

“McMaster has confirmed that this sign was false, and there is no cause for concern,” the university said on Twitter.

Durham College in Oshawa was also busy de-bunking fake social media posts, saying “there are no known cases of the coronavirus at DC.”
