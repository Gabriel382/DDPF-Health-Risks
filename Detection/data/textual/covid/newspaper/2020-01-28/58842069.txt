Moves to Support Coronavirus-Hit Wuhan Spread in Japan - JIJI PRESS 
 Tokyo, Jan. 28 (Jiji Press)--People from around Japan are stepping up support for remaining residents in locked-down Wuhan, a major Chinese city at the center of a coronavirus outbreak. 

    Inagora Inc., an e-commerce operator based in Tokyo, launched a campaign Monday to ship face masks to residents in Wuhan and other parts of the Hubei province free of charge. The operator of the Wandou e-commerce platform to sell Japanese goods to Chinese customers saw all 10,000 packages containing five face masks each "sold out" in roughly an hour after applications for orders began.

    "I hope people there can spend the Luna New Year holiday at ease," said Inagora spokesperson Kanako Itano.

    According to Itano, paid orders for face masks have skyrocketed since the new coronavirus outbreak, by up to some 300-fold per day. Orders for antibacterial sheets, mouthwash and hand soaps have also exploded.

    The city of Oita, southwestern Japan, sent 30,000 masks it had saved up for disaster relief purposes on Monday in boxed with a message reading "Wuhan Jiayou!" meaning "Hang in there, Wuhan!" in Chinese. Oita and Wuhan have been sister cities for 40 years.
