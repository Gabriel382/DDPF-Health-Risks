'Everyone is scared' in Wuhan over coronavirus threat 
 Australian businessman Rui Severino has spoken with Sky News about his experiences as he remains in 'lock down' within the Chinese city of Wuhan, which is currently in the grips of the deadly coronavirus threat. In China, the death toll has risen to 81 with a further 2,400 people infected with the virus, while there are fears another 1,000 cases could be confirmed in Wuhan alone. Mr Rui said he had travelled to the country for business, but currently remains isolated in the city due to the spread of the virus. "Everyone is scared," Mr Rui told Sky News host Chris Smith. "We are hopeful and we are staying positive," he said. Image: Getty
