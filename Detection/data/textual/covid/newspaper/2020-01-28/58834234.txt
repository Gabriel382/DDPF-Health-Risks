Colorado native quarantined in China due to coronavirus 
 A Colorado native who has lived in China for nearly a decade says he and his family are stranded as Chinese authorities respond to the coronavirus outbreak.

Max Siewert, of Louisville, moved to China almost seven years ago to teach English. There, he met his wife and the two eventually formed a family. Siewert, his wife and their 4-month-old daughter live in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and where the virus first surfaced last month.


“We were kind of joking about it ’cause a lot of people never heard of Wuhan until now; I know it’s kind of infamous,’” Siewert said, adding the measures that have been taken by authorities in the area — mainly travel restrictions by land and air — have created stress and uncertainty.


“It adds a psychological component because we don’t really know how bad the virus is,” Siewert said. “They officially announced they were stopping flights and trains out of Wuhan.”
