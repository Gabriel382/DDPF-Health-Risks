A fine line between 'panic and protection' over coronavirus fears 
 Adoni Media Managing Director Leisa Goddard says "there's a fine line ... between panic and community protection" in relation to the deadly coronavirus threat in Australia. On Tuesday, New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard called for parents to keep their children home from school if they had been to China within the last 14 days. Ms Goddard told Sky News host Peter Gleeson she was aware of private schools actually messaging parents with a warning about the virus. "From a parent's perspective, there would be that concern when you have schools taking these measures," she said. Image: Getty
