Dow brings 5-session skid to a halt as stocks attempt to shake off coronavirus anxieties 
 U.S. stock indexes on Tuesday staged a solid comeback after the worst daily decline for stocks in months, following a downturn that had been at least partly sparked by concerns about the spread of an Asian influenza. Although the so-called Wuhan virus, named for the city in China where it is said to have originated, continues to spread in the second-largest economy in the world, claiming at least 106 lives and infecting more than 4,500 people, investors deemed Monday's equity slump to be overdone and bought beaten-down shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.65% gained 186 points, or 0.7%, to 28,722, halting a 5-session slide. The S&P 500 index SPX, +1.01% advanced 1% to 3,276, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.43% rose 1.4% to close at 9,269, both indexes ended a two-session slide. Uneasiness about the spread of the the illness that has drawn comparisons with SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and the possible impact to China's economy, comes as the Federal Reserve on Wednesday is slated to provide an update on monetary policy, with key interest rates at 1.50%-1.75% range. In company news, Apple Inc. AAPL, +2.83% is among the S&P 500 and Dow components set to report after Tuesday's close. Apple suppliers have cautioned that the coronavirus could impact the iPhone maker's output. Market participants also have noted that an accurate recession indicator, the differential, or spread, between the three-year Treasury bill TMUBMUSD03M, +0.99% and the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.35%, briefly inverted early Tuesday.
