UST Hospital belies reports of admitting novel coronavirus patient 
 MANILA, Philippines — The University of Santo Tomas Hospital (USTH) on Tuesday denied that they admitted a patient infected with novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.

“We would like to inform the public that there is no truth to the circulating news in social media and text messages of a novel coronavirus patient in USTH,” the hospital’s management said in a memorandum posted on the Twitter page of The Varsitarian, UST’s official student publication.

The USTH management said it implemented a protocol for handling patients with suspected 2019-nCoV.
