Japanese Experts Warn of False Coronavirus Stories - JIJI PRESS 
 Tokyo, Jan. 28 (Jiji Press)--With false information about a new type of coronavirus believed to be behind a pneumonia outbreak in China spreading on social media, Japanese experts are calling on people not to circulate rumors. 

    Around Friday, a rumor spread on Twitter that a Chinese tourist who might be infected with the new coronavirus was at large after entering Japan through Kansai International Airport.

    The operator of the airport in Osaka Prefecture, western Japan, rushed to stamp out the rumor, calling for people to be "cautious about uncertain information."

    In Hakone, a hot spring resort area in Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo, a snack shop owner put up a poster on the store front saying things such as, "Entry of Chinese people is prohibited," and "We don't want them to spread the virus."

    After facing a backlash, the owner apologized, saying, "I went too far."
