House summons Duque for ‘question hour’ on novel coronavirus 
 MANILA, Philippines — The House of Representatives on Tuesday approved a motion summoning Health Secretary Francisco Duque for a “question hour” regarding the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.

House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez moved to hold a question hour with Duque on Wednesday, January 29, at the House’s plenary session hall.

Romualdez said that Duque would be asked to answer questions regarding the measures being undertaken by the Department of Health against the threat of novel coronavirus in the country.

“I move that the Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III be requested to appear before the House of Representatives under the question hour,” Romualdez said.

The motion was approved by the members of the House.

In a separate statement, Romualdez said the House is invoking its question hour privilege not in aid of legislation nor for investigation purposes.

The question hour, Romualdez said, would give Duque a “bigger platform” to address the concerns of the public.

“There are numerous reports about possible infection in several areas of the country. We need to know which of these are real and which are fake news,” Romualdez said.

The health department on Tuesday said that the Philippines have 24 patients under investigation (PUIs) for the suspected novel coronavirus.

Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said most of the PUIs are from China.
