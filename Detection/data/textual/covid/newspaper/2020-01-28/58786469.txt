SINGAPORE — Two Facebook users made a falsehood by alleging that Woodlands MRT station was closed on Tuesday (28 January) for disinfection due to a suspect case of the Wuhan coronavirus, the POFMA Office said.

The station was not closed on the day and was fully operational, added the POFMA Office, which oversees the administration of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).

The Minister for Transport has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a correction direction to Facebook. The social media giant is required to carry a correction notice on the two Facebook posts which contained the falsehood.

The POFMA Office asked the public to refer to the Factually article,“Corrections and Clarifications Regarding Falsehood that Woodlands MRT Closed for Disinfection”.

It also asked the public not to speculate or spread unfounded rumours, and instead rely on the Ministry of Health’s website and the Gov.sg WhatsApp to get timely and accurate information regarding the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.
