Oil Search falls 7pc on weak production goals 
 Listed lighting retailer Beacon Lighting has warned investors its underlying profit for the half was significantly down on the prior corresponding period, blaming a weak market, bushfires, and a languishing Aussie dollar as major factors for the drop. Shares in the company plunged 7 per cent to $1.06 in early trade, spurred on by a 1.7 per cent drop across the ASX 200 as coronavirus fears spooked traders.
In a trading update on Tuesday morning the company said its underlying net profit after tax would be $9 million for the first half of 2020, down from $11.5 million in the first half of 2019. Margins also dropped, coming in at 64.7 per cent compared to 66.7 per cent in the first half of the last financial year.
The company said the weak Aussie dollar had a significant impact on its underlying profit figures, but also blamed an “inability to immediately adjust prices to our customers during a period of soft consumer confidence”. 
At a statutory level, the company’s profit improved on the prior corresponding half, up 9.4 per cent due to $12.6 million following a $5.4 million profit after tax gain from the sale and leaseback of its Parkinson Distribution Centre. However, the closure of the company’s solar power business, Beacon Energy Solutions, saw a $2.3 million loss for the first half.
Trading conditions into 2020 have shown some improvement, the company said, but remained inconsistent due to poor confidence and the ongoing impact from the bushfires and poor weather conditions.
