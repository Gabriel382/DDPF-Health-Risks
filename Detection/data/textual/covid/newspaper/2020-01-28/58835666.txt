The survey is the latest sign that Bloomberg's massive advertising campaign appears to be paying off in the polls.

Bloomberg, who is not fundraising, has already spent $270 million on advertising across the country ahead of the primary contests.

His campaign on Monday began sending mailers to 2.5 million Democratic primary voters across the country.

Bloomberg, who is not competing in Iowa and New Hampshire, has focused specifically on the Super Tuesday states.

Despite his late entry into the race, Bloomberg's campaign staff continues to grow, reaching 800 staffers earlier this month.

Bloomberg also appears to be making inroads among lawmakers, scoring his fifth congressional endorsement on Monday.

The Morning Consult survey was conducted on Jan. 20-26 and is based on 17,836 surveys with Democratic primary voters.
