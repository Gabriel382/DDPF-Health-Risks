Inside Wuhan: Cooking and celebrating birthday in Coronavirus lockdown 
 Ben Kavanagh is working as a teacher in Wuhan – the city under quarantine as the deadly coronavirus continues to spread across China.

Ben has been stuck in his flat for the duration of the lockdown.

Today, he’s celebrating his birthday – alone in his flat, having enjoyed a simple dinner out of stockpiled rations and ventured into the eery empty city to throw out garbage and find water.

He took his phone along to film it all for us. Like Ben, millions of Wuhan locals are in lockdown, as China’s health minister warns that the virus is ‘getting stronger’.

Over 100 people have now died and more than 4,500 are infected – with many of those infected not yet displaying symptoms.
