In fact, China has emerged as our 10th largest export destination for engineering goods, dominated by iron and steel as also industrial machinery,'' said EEPC chairman Mr Ravi Sehgal. He said, the government high level review has directed the Ministry of Shipping to initiate entry screening at the international ports having traffic from China. With disruptions reported in China due to transport and travel restrictions in several cities, we are trying to ascertain the exact impact on the trade, Mr Sehgal said.
