The pandemic, unfortunately, hit during one of China's most auspicious months. It's the Chinese New Year and so, some residents decided to make each other feel better and keep up the festive spirit.
 About 5 million residents left Wuhan before the lock-down because of the deadly coronavirus and the Spring Festival holiday. According to the BBC, Spring Festival is the world's biggest annual human migration but because of the lockdown, stations are empty this year. 

The central government imposed a curfew on Wuhan and several cities hoping to stop the new virus from spreading to other parts of the country. However, many had already left the city for the holiday, while others rushed out after the lockdown was announced on Wednesday night.

The Chinese State Council has extended the Lunar New Year holiday to February 2 to curb the spread of the virus, according to state broadcaster CCTV.  
According to reports, more than 44 cases have been confirmed abroad including Thailand, the United States and Australia. The youngest patient is a 9-month-old girl in Beijing.
