As Coronavirus Spreads, Hong Kong Limits Border Traffic With Mainland China 
 HONG KONG — Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s top official, said on Tuesday that the city would cut the number of visitors from mainland China in an effort to control the spread of the new coronavirus that emerged in the city of Wuhan last month.
The limits, including reductions in plane, rail, bus and ferry arrivals, will begin at midnight Thursday. They follow days of increasing pressure from health care workers, epidemiologist and even pro-Beijing politicians who have traditionally supported Mrs. Lam’s government.
Hong Kong has eight confirmed cases of the coronavirus, all of which came from mainland China.
