House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez said they summoned Duque so the Cabinet official would get a “bigger platform” to determine “which are real and which are fake news” about the new disease, which has killed at least 106 people in China as of Tuesday, January 28.

The novel coronavirus originated from Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in China.

While there are still no confirmed nCov cases in the Philippines, the Department of Health is monitoring 24 people with flu symptoms.
