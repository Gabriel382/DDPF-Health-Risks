Coronavirus: Wuhan's new hospitals rising fast to meet deadly virus's threat 
 China appears to be making good on its vow to build two new hospitals in Wuhan to battle the coronavirus outbreak. As UK ministers announced plans to evacuate any Britons remaining in the city, pictures show construction is moving rapidly on the facilities, designed to treat 2,300 people. The base for the hospital is clearly visible, with a number of cranes and dozens of construction workers at the site, which was bare in pictures at the weekend. The first hospital, containing 1,000 beds, is due to be ready to take in its first patients next Tuesday, just 11 days after work began. Around 2,000 medical workers are expected to treat patients, the Xihau News Agency said. It will be built with prefabricated buildings around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers. China, which has a reputation for throwing huge resources at problems, has said it will build four hospitals in total. Two of the urgent projects are in Wuhan, one named Leishanshan or Thunder God Mountain Hospital. The virus, which originated in Wuhan and is transmitted from human to human, has now killed more than 100 people and infected at least 4,500 across China. Most of the fatalities have occurred in the central Chinese province of Hubei. China has a history of quickly building hospitals at times of crisis. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, 7,000 people worked day and night in Beijing, taking just seven days to build the Xiaotangshan facility. It is believed to hold the world record for the fastest construction of a hospital and is thought to have treated one-seventh of China's SARS patients at the time. That building is believed to be the template for the two prefabricated hospitals being built in Wuhan. Dozens of diggers and bulldozers arrived at the 25,000 sq metre site on the outskirts of the city on Thursday.
