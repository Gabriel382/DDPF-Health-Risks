Britons warned against travel to mainland China 
 The Foreign Office is warning Britons not to travel to mainland China, unless their journey is essential. 
Its updated advice comes amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has caused more than 100 deaths, spread across China and to at least 16 other countries.
There have been no confirmed cases in the UK so far.
The FCO also advises against all travel to Hubei Province, saying anyone there who can leave should do so. 
In its China advice on the gov.uk website, it said: "The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China (not including Hong Kong and Macao).
"The Chinese government continue to impose further restrictions on movement within China in response to the coronavirus outbreak. 
"It may become harder over the coming weeks for those who wish to leave China to do so. If you feel that you may want to leave China soon, you should consider making plans to do so before any further restrictions may be imposed."
