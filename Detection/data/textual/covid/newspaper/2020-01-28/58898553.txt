World Indoor championships could be SCRAPPED amid coronavirus fears 
 A decision is expected in the next fortnight over whether to scrap the World Indoor championships in Nanjing after the outbreak of the coronavirus in China.

World Athletics are holding regular discussions with the World Health Organisation over the safety of staging the event in the region from March 13 to March 15, with the virus having now infected in excess of 4,500 people across 16 countries, causing more than 100 deaths.

The epicentre of the virus is in Wuhan, around 300 miles west of Nanjing, and Sportsmail understands a call by World Athletics on how to proceed will be made within the next two weeks.

A World Athletics spokesperson told Sportsmail: 'World Athletics is monitoring this situation carefully and is in close contact with the World Health Organisation.

'Should any of their advice affect plans for the World Indoor Championships Nanjing 2020, we will notify all our stakeholders promptly.'

UK Athletics has been tracking the situation closely ahead of picking a team which is expected to be under strength, with none of the leading trio of Dina Asher-Smith, Katarina Johnson-Thompson or Laura Muir targeting the championships in an Olympic year.

The Asian Athletics Association confirmed on Sunday it would be cancelling its Indoor Championships, which were scheduled to be held next month in Hangzhou, 350 miles from Wuhan.
