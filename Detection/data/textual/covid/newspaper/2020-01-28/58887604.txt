Foreign Office warns Brits against travel to China amid coronavirus outbreak 
 The Foreign Office has warned Brits against “all but essential travel” to mainland China in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak.

It has already claimed 106 lives, with the number of infections almost doubling in a day to more than 4,500.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has advised against all travel to Hubei Province, the epicentre of the outbreak.

FCO guidance reads: “Due to increasing travel restrictions and difficulty accessing medical assistance, the FCO is working to make an option available for British nationals to leave Hubei Province.

“This may happen quickly and with short notice.

“If you’re a British national in Hubei Province and need assistance, contact our 24/7 number +86 (0) 10 8529 6600 or the FCO in London on (+44) (0)207 008 1500 to register your desire to leave before 29 January at 11am local time.

“You will be contacted once arrangements are confirmed.”

There have been 97 cases of suspected coronavirus tested in the UK, but so far no positive diagnoses.

British ministers have said they are working to get Brits out of Hubei province in China, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisting the government is doing “everything we can”.

China’s President Xi Jinping today said the government will defeat the “devil” virus after meeting the World Health Organisation (WHO) chief.

He told state television: “The virus is a devil and we cannot let the devil hide. China will strengthen international cooperation and welcomes the WHO participation in virus prevention.

“China is confident of winning the battle against the virus.”

Taiwan reported its first case of domestic transmission of the new coronavirus on Tuesday and also raised its travel warning for China.

Its Central Epidemic Command Centre said the latest patient, the eighth, was the first case of transmission on the island.

In all the previous cases, the patients had first been infected in China.
