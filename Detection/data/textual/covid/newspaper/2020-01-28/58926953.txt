The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is advising New Zealanders against making non-essential travel to China.

It previously advised travellers to not travel to Hubei, the province where Coronavirus is believed to have originated. The virus has so far killed 106 people in China, with more than 4565 cases of infection.

The safetravel.govt.nz website now said travellers should avoid non-essential travel elsewhere in China due to the outbreak.

* Travel insurers may not pay out for passengers caught by coronavirus​

 * Coronavirus cases highly likely to arrive in NZ, health officials say as they seek extra quarantine powers

 * 'Significant' tourism cancellations in wake of coronavirus outbreak

It follows the Australian government in telling its people to reconsider the need to travel to China due to travel restrictions by local authorities.

On Wednesday morning Australia's travel information website smarttraveller.gov.au updated its advice on travel to China to a level three, meaning "there are serious and potentially life-threatening risks" to visitors there.

"This can make the destination unsafe for tourism and unsuitable for most travellers," it said.

"Do your research and check that your insurer will cover you. If you do travel, take extra safety precautions."
