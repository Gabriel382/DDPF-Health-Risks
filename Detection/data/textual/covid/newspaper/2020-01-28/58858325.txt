Coronavirus medics on 'suicide mission like doomed Chernobyl firefighters' 
 Brave medical staff at the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak have been likened to Chernobyl firefighters “on a suicide mission”.

The country has mobilised hundreds of medical and emergency personnel to help fight the virus which has killed 106 people and infected thousands in recent weeks.

Heartbreaking footage shows families sobbing and waving goodbye to their loved ones as they leave home to help combat the deadly virus.

US politician, Solomon Yue, hailed their brave efforts but reminded followers that many medics sent to Wuhan "won't come back to their loved ones".

He wrote on Twitter: "Like Chernobyl firefighters, some of those doctors and nurses WON'T come back to their loved ones.”

“This is a coronavirus suicide mission for many of them. God bless them."

The Chernobyl disaster caused at least 62 deaths, including dozens of first responders who heroically tackled the blaze in the knowledge they would likely die from the fatal dose of radiation.

The flu-like virus broke out in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year and has killed 106 people and infected more than 2,800 people since then.

It spreads in droplets from coughs and sneezes and has an incubation period of 1-14 days.

Harrowing footage from a hospital at 'frontline' shows a nurse breaking down in tears after realising she will have to spend Chinese New Year in hospital.

The distressing clip, taken inside what appears to be a communal rest room, captures a hopeless nurse crying loudly as she yells: "I can't take this anymore!"

Her colleagues can be seen going over to comfort her while she cries her lungs out.

A group of five or six group nurses are seen sobbing quietly while having their food.

The video's caption reads: "While Xi Jinping is enjoying his good time at Chinese New Year, the nurses in Wuhan are going mental!"
