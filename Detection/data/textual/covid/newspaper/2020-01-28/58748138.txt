 BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand expects the number of Chinese tourists to fall by 2 million to 9 million this year due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, the Tourism Authority of Thailand said on Tuesday.

Tourism has been hit hard by China's ban on all group tours. Chinese tourists, Thailand's biggest source of visitors, were numbered about 11 million last year.
