Coronavirus death toll rises to at least 106 
 The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has soared to at least 106. More than 4,000 others have been infected, as cities around the world scramble to cap the spread of the disease. Germany reported its first case of the virus, and the United States and Canada have updated their travel advice, warning citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to China. The boss of the World Health Organisation is in China, examining the handling of the response. There are now five confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia after NSW Health reported a 21-year-old woman travelling from Wuhan had contracted the virus. Image: AP
