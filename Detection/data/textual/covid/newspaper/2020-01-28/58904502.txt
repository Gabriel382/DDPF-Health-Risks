Parañaque conducts nCoV info drive to calm residents 
 The Parañaque government on Tuesday finally stepped in to allay residents’ fears over a possible novel coronavirus outbreak in the city, particularly in the upscale Multinational Village in Barangay Moonwalk, which hosts scores of Chinese nationals working for offshore gambling companies based in the country.

Mel Marquez, acting spokesperson for some residents of the subdivision, said the city health office had started an information campaign on the virus—also called 2019-nCoV—originating from Wuhan, China, that had since infected thousands across the globe.

However, it appears the city government has found no need just yet to screen the Chinese nationals staying in the village, despite a written request from Marquez and other homeowners.

For now, city officials will focus on information dissemination to prevent the spread of the disease. But should the need arise, they promised to hold medical missions.

At one session, mostly focused on basic information about the virus and how to protect one’s self, over 200 residents were in attendance, Marquez said.

In the meantime, Barangay Moonwalk chair Obet Alano promised to strictly enforce a village policy requiring foreigners to submit records in order to rent spaces or conduct business.

Barangay officials and residents would be meeting soon to formulate ways to enhance the implementation of the policy, Marquez said.

He and several homeowners earlier claimed that the “speedy turnover” of workers for Philippine offshore gaming operator centers based in the city had increased their risk of being infected with the virus.

The exact number of the Chinese nationals living in Multinational Village is being disputed.

According to homeowners’ association chair Arnel Gacutan, there are around 3,000 Chinese renting houses in the area. Marquez, however, claims a much higher estimate of 7,500.
