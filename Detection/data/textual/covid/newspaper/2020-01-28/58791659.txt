The coronavirus has killed more than 100 people to date. Cases have been reported in at least 16 countries around the world, including the US, Canada, France, and Australia, with over 4,500 reported in China alone.The virus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, and has since spread throughout China and beyond. As a result, the city of Wuhan was quarantined by Chinese authorities on Thursday.Wuhan's mayor has said around 5 million people evacuated the city before it was quarantined, with roughly 9 million remaining in the city post-quarantine.It's possible that Facebook will proactively seek to help curb the coronavirus if it continues to spread.



In 2014, when the deadly Ebola virus remained uncontained, the social media giant launched multiple initiatives to help try and stop the virus. These included placing a donation notification window at the top of users' news feeds.CEO Mark Zuckerberg also donated $25 million to Ebola containment efforts along with his wife Priscilla Chan.
