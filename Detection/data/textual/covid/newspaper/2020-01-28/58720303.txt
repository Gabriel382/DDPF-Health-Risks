DFA: Filipinos in China can come home, but will be placed under quarantine 
 MANILA, Philippines — Any Filipino living in China can back home, so as long as they agree to place themselves under quarantine following the virus scare caused by the novel coronavirus, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said Tuesday.

“As Secretary Francisco Duque III said as chair of the inter-agency task force, we came out with the decision, the task force has come out with the decision that any Filipino who wants to come home can come home, except that they will be placed under quarantine for 14 days, also for their own protection as well as the protection of their families also,” DFA Undersecretary Brigido Dulay said in a press briefing with the Department of Health (DOH).

“In that respect, they are all free to go, we are now asking our missions to now collate the number of Filipinos, as well as the names of those who would like to come home under that condition,” he added.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Sunday recorded a total of 2,014 confirmed cases of the virus or 2019-nCoV globally.
