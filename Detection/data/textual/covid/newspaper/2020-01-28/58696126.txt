Fifth case of coronavirus confirmed in Aus as schools introduce strict rules to curb outbreak 
 Australia's Chief Medical Officer says there's no need for concern among the public over the deadly coronavirus. There are now five confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia after NSW Health reported a 21-year-old woman travelling from Wuhan had contracted the virus. As health authorities work to contain the virus, schools across the country are introducing their own measures to curb the spread. Some Australian schools have banned students who visited China over the summer holiday from returning to class without a medical certificate to prove their well-being. The measures come after the University of New South Wales confirmed one of its students was diagnosed with the virus. In China, the death toll has risen to 81 with a further 2,400 people infected. The Chinese Government has committed $13 billion to contain the spread of the virus. Image: AP
