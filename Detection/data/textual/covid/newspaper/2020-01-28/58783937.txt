BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Tuesday that it could help finance the repatriation of Europeans affected by the coronavirus in China through a so-called EU Civil Protection Mechanism. 
A spokesman for the blocâ€™s executive told a news briefing that there had not been any requests so far from EU member states for help with repatriation of citizens.
