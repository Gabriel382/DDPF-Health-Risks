Ardern laughs off rejecting PM Morrison's mid-news conference call 
 Jacinda Ardern has laughed off rejecting a call from Scott Morrison after the Australian prime minister inadvertently crashed his New Zealand counterpart’s news conference. The New Zealand prime minister was being asked if her country would tag on to Australia’s efforts to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan amid the deepening coronavirus spread, when Mr Morrison attempted to get in contact. Ms Ardern laughed off the interruption and told reporters “that’s PM Morrison dialling in as we speak” before rejecting the call and saying she would continue to talk with her counterparts on the issue.
