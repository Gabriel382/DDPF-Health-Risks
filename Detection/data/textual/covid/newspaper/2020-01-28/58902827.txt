We are with You, Wuhan 
 TRONâ€™s global community and partners are closely monitoring those affected by Coronavirus worldwide. We are deeply concerned and aware of the extreme shortage of medical supplies in Wuhan, China, hence we are calling all the Tronics around the world to help those affected by sending medical necessities immediately.
These supplies include goggles, face masks, food, water, and various medical supplies, and anything else needed to help them overcome this crisis.
This is a global priority for us as this epidemic vividly exemplifies that even as interconnected as we are on the internet, we are just as connected in our physical bodies.
The community has reacted urgently and we have already received commitments from various community members from Korea, Singapore, North America, and EU, as well as corporations within the TRON ecosystem including BitTorrent, Poloniex, DLive, and WINk, with more to be confirmed.
We are also coordinating with some of the largest logistics companies around the world to help deliver and distribute these supplies as soon as possible, to whoever is in need.
We would like to thank the Tronics from around the world, who have already begun to help us fight, isolate, and defeat this virus.
Wuhan, you are not alone. Tronics around the world will pray for you and our hearts are with you! We are distributed, but we are all in this together.
Jia You Wuhan!
