Australians told to 'reconsider your need to travel' to China 
 The government has told Australians to reconsider any travel plans to China as the coronavirus continues to spread. The Department of Foreign Affairs raised its warning status after consultations with the Chinese Government. Foreign Minister Marise Payne made the announcement on Twitter, saying “we now advise you to reconsider your need to travel to China overall, due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus and travel restrictions by local authorities”. The government is working to help 400 Australians stranded in Wuhan. China's coronavirus death toll has risen above 100, with travel bans imposed on almost 60 million people to stop it from spreading further. Image: AP
