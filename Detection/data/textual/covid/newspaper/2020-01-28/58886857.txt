Azar stops short of declaring public health emergency for Wuhan coronavirus 
 The Trump administration today stopped short of declaring a public health emergency for the Wuhan coronavirus but extended screening for the virus to 20 U.S. airports.

HHS Secretary Alex Azar said at a briefing the administration has offered assistance from the CDC to Chinese authorities either directly or in conjunction with the World Health Organization but has not yet received the go-ahead, though representatives are still talking. The CDC already has a limited presence in China but U.S. public health officials want more epidemiological expertise on the ground, both to assist the Chinese and learn more about the virus.

As Azar spoke, the WHO announced it struck an agreement with China to bring in international experts "as soon as possible," but didn't elaborate on details such as whether American officials will be involved.
