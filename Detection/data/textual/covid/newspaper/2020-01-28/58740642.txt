Students from Bengaluru stuck in Hong Kong amid coronavirus outbreak | Bengaluru News - Times of India 
 BENGALURU: Bengalureans studying in universities in Hong Kong are again in limbo after the coronavirus scare hit mainland China. Classes, which were supposed to begin after they were called off in mid-November following violent protests, have again been deferred till mid-February. Till then, students will have to attend classes online.While some city students had returned to their campuses in the last week of January expecting classes would resume, some who are yet to travel back are glad they haven't. TOI had earlier reported how students attended lecturers and took exams online after they were asked to return home following protests over the introduction of Fugitive Offenders Bill ."Our classes were supposed to start on February 3, but have been deferred till February 17. Till then, we will attend classes online. Even though libraries and other facilities are still open, people tend to stay indoors. Most of us are staying back as the university has told us that travelling now will be even more dangerous. But if the condition gets worse in the next few weeks, we might think of flying back," said Harshita, a first-year BBA student at University of Hong Kong."We have been asked to take precautions. We have been wearing masks, using hand sanitisers and have been mostly staying indoors," said Payas, a second-year engineering student of City University of Hong Kong."Once again our studies have taken a hit. The university sent a message saying the on-campus exam will be held from February 17 and classes for spring term will commence from February 21. Other adjustments for university activities had also been made," rued Dhruv Jain, a third-year biotechnology student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), who is currently in India.
