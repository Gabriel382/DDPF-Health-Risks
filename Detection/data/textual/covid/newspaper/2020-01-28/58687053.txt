China nearly finishes building new hospital to fight Coronavirus in just 4 days 
 A NEW hospital being built in China in a bid to battle the outbreak of the deadly Coronavirus looks half-way built after just four days work.

The 1,000-bed medical institution in Wuhan has sprung up in just a matter of days and is expected to be complete by the end of the week.

China is naming the hastily constructed hospital Huoshenshan which means “Fire God Mountain Hospital”.

Wuhan is the province in China where Coronovirus was first detected and the hospital takes up six acres of land there.

It is said to be built up of a number of temporary buildings and shipping containers and will take its first patients on February 3rd.

The hospital is a copy of a makeshift one built in Beijing in 2003 in response to the SARS epidemic.

China has said it will build four hospitals in total in a speedy response to the deadly virus that has so far killed 81.

The majority of those deaths, 76 people, were all in the central province of Hubei.

Around 2,800 people worldwide are said to have been infected with the killer virus across 14 countries.

Shanghai reported its first death on Saturday, January 25.

Across China there have been 2,744 confirmed cases, with 1,423 cases being in Hubei.

The youngest confirmed case is a nine-year-old girl in Beijing.

There has been no reported deaths from coronavirus outside of China.
