Coronavirus: Ghanaian students in China safe – Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms 
 The Foreign Affairs Ministry has confirmed that no Ghanaian student in China has contracted the novel coronavirus. The deadly virus is fast spreading in China since it broke in Wuhan and the death toll now stands at 106. 

 

 Some over 100 Ghanaian students in the city requested for evacuation and transportation back to Ghana following the outbreak but in a statement from the Foreign Ministry, there is no reason for fear. 

 

 According to them, no student has been affected so far and such will continue to be the case if all students ‘adhere to preventive precautions outlined by Chinese authorities’. 

 

 “No Ghanaian has contracted the novel coronavirus even though we have about one hundred and fifty-two (152) students in Wuhan where the virus was first reported.” 

 

 They confirmed that the Embassy of Ghana in Beijing and the Consulate-General in Guangzhou are in contact with the leadership of the Ghanaian community and the National Union of Ghana students-China and receive frequent briefing from them on the welfare of all Ghanaian nationals. 

 

 Meanwhile, students who earlier requested for evacuation have suspended plans following government intervention. Following the outbreak, Ghanaian students in the Wuhan city requested that the Ghanaian government transport them to Ghana because they had run out of food and were stuck indoors. 

 

 Travel restrictions have been tightened and wearing masks in public is now mandatory in some cities. 

 

 The city of Wuhan is at the epicentre of the outbreak but it has spread across China and internationally. Ever since the disease surfaced in China, many countries are on the alert to ensure it does not find its way to their setting. 

 

 Health officials in Ghana have tightened surveillance at the borders and also at the airport with a particular focus on Chinese returnees.
