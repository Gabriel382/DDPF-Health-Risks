Airline stocks face 'substantial' risk from coronavirus but not lasting weakness, analyst says 
 Airline stocks were mostly higher Tuesday, bouncing from a sharp two-day selloff related to concerns over the rapid spread of the deadly coronavirus out of China. The NYSE Arca Airline Index XAL, +1.15% rose 0.9%, after tumbling 4.8% the previous two sessions to close Monday at an 8-week low, while the S&P 500 SPX, +1.07% bounced 1.1% after falling 2.5% the past two days. Based on an analysis of the impact of other deadly pandemics, analyst Ken Herbert at Canaccord Genuity said that while the current coronavirus outbreak is still in the very early stages, the risk to worldwide air travel and the aerospace sector is "substantial," as the eventual impact could be worse than previous pandemics this millennium based on the inital outbreak. Herbert looked at the impact of the SARS outbreak in 2003, the avian flu pandemic in 2005 and the MERS outbreak in 2015. "[W]e believe that all things considered, traffic tends to recover relatively quickly after a pandemic outbreak," Herbert wrote in a note to clients. "Moreover, there does not seem to be a clear lasting impact on the stocks...as a result of these outbreaks." Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, +1.46% rose 1.4%, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, -0.73% slipped 0.6%, Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +0.79% edged up 0.7% and Boeing Co. BA, -0.51% fell 0.5%.
