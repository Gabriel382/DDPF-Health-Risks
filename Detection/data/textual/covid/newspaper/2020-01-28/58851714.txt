The White House is considering imposing travel restrictions on China amid an escalating death toll from the new coronavirus, sources said Tuesday.

The restrictions could affect flights into and out of China, as well as airports across the United States.

No final decision has been made. A senior staff meeting was held at the White House on Monday during which the restrictions were discussed.

A press conference is scheduled for later Tuesday at the Department of Health and Human Services.

The new coronavirus has killed 106 people and infected more than 4,500, according to Chinese health authorities. It was first diagnosed late last month.
