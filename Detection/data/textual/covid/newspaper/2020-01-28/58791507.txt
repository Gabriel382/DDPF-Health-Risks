JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s rand firmed slightly against the dollar early on Tuesday, after hitting a more than six-week low in the previous session, although concerns over the fast-spreading coronavirus  and weak domestic economicoutlook weighed on sentiment.   
At 0640 GMT, the rand traded at 14.5800 per dollar, 0.17% firmer than its previous close. 
The currency slipped to 14.6570 per dollar on Monday, its weakest since Dec. 12, with the selloff largely driven by investors dumping emerging market assets. 
Nedbank analysts wrote in a note the risk-off scenario was “likely to continue until the coronavirus is brought under control.”

The rand is the most fragile among its emerging market peers as investors are also cautious about South Africa’s poor economic outlook and possible downgrade to junk by Moody’s. 
Finance Minister Tito Mboweni gives his budget speech on Feb. 26, with Moody’s — the last of the top three agencies to still rate the country at an investment level — set to review its credit rating a week later.
