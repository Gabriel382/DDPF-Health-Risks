TOKYO (Reuters) - A person in Japan who had not visited the Chinese city of Wuhan has contracted the new coronavirus, Japanâ€™s health ministry said Tuesday. 
The infected man is a tour bus driver in his 60s from Nara prefecture, who had contact with visitors from Wuhan between Jan. 8-16, the ministry said on its website. He began showing symptoms on Jan. 14 and was hospitalized on Jan. 25 before being diagnosed, according to the statement. 
Another man in his 40s who lives in Wuhan was also confirmed to have contracted the virus, the ministry said.  
The new infections bring the total number of confirmed Japanese cases to six.
