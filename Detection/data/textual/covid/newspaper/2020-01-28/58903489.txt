Issue travel ban ASAP 
 The Department of Health must seriously consider issuing a travel advisory/ban for airlines and travelers alike amid the rising death toll from the coronavirus that originated in China—and just do it ASAP. Our people have suffered long enough from natural disasters such as floods, typhoons, earthquakes, drought and, most recently, a volcanic eruption.

We do not want this killer virus to spread in our country, for Pete’s sake! People in airports, planes, trains, cars, taxis and even ships must be wary of touching surfaces that may be contaminated by it.

If we really need to travel, it would be wise to take precautionary measures and preparations like wearing face masks, using alcohol or sanitizer, boosting our immune system by taking appropriate vitamins and minerals, getting enough rest/sleep, and paying a visit to our doctors.
