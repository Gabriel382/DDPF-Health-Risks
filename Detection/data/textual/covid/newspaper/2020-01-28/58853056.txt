      Taiwan reported its first case of domestic transmission of the new coronavirus on Tuesday and raised its travel warning for China, saying people should avoid going unless absolutely necessary following the outbreak of the virus there.
 
Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre said the latest patient, the eighth, was the first case of transmission on the island as in all the previous cases the people had been infected first in China.

The new patient, a man in his 50s from central Taiwan, was infected by his wife after she returned from working in China and before she was subsequently diagnosed, the command centre said. The man is in a stable condition, it said.

Separately, the command centre said it would extend to the rest of China an earlier warning not to go to Hubei province unless totally necessary, though Hong Kong and Macau are excluded. Taiwan has also restricted the vast majority of Chinese visitors.

      India and Bangladesh have said they are working on evacuating their citizens from Wuhan in China.
 
Indian state airline Air India was on standby to evacuate an estimated 250 Indians from Wuhan in Hubei province, local media reported earlier.

"We have begun the process to prepare for evacuation of Indian nationals affected by the situation arising out of Corona-2019 virus outbreak in Hubei Province, China," Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in a tweet.

He said Indian authorities were working out the logistics of moving people out of the city of 11 million people that is under a lockdown.

In Bangladesh, Foreign Minister Abdul Momen said talks were underway to bring back Bangladeshi citizens from China.

      Ninety-seven tests for the coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, the Department of Health and Social Care has confirmed.
 
All 97 came back negative - meaning there are still no confirmed cases of the illness in the UK.

      A British citizen stuck in Wuhan, China, has said he is too afraid to leave his flat for fear of infecting his nine-month-old daughter with the deadly coronavirus.
 
The 22-year-old from Manchester, who asked to remain anonymous, told the PA news agency: "My wife is staying positive but inside I can tell she's worried, we both are. We know that if our baby got sick she wouldn't make it and that's a horrible, dreadful feeling."
 
Neither of them have been diagnosed with the illness but fear coming into contact with anyone who may carry the deadly strain.
 
The family have not left their flat for a week, and are now rationing food to get through the outbreak.
 
He said: "The flat bit isn't that bad, it's more the paranoia every time I go out in the corridor to empty bins or something like that.
 
"My wife's family gave us a lot of leftover meat and vegetables from the New Year's dinner we had. We think that will last us a few more weeks."

      Professor Yvonne Doyle of PHE said the first UK case is likely to come from somebody already in the country.

In an interview with Sky News, she said: "Our view is that, although airports are important, the most likely place that we might find a case is somebody in the country already, and it's absolutely critical that the public health service and the NHS are ready to diagnose that and are able to designate the person to the right facilities.

"That's the most likely scenario we are dealing with."

Asked if there could be cases already in Britain, she said: "I would expect so."
 
Some 73 people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK, though all tests have come back negative.

      A tourist from Taiwan has claimed people ran away from him in Croatia because they were afraid of catching the coronavirus.
 
 
"People are afraid of Chinese because they think chinese has Wuhan coronavirus nowaday," he said. "People see me and they run away in Croatia. They think I am from China. So I wrote “Not from China” on the paper, and people see me and they laughed."

      Finnish airline Finnair has announced it will suspend its routes to Nanjing and Beijing's Daxing airport until the end of March.
 
The company said it made the decision in response to China's suspension of all group travel out of the country.
 
It is the first European airline to cancel flights to mainland China amid growing fears about the spread of the new coronavirus.
 
However Finnair will continue to operate daily flights to Beijing Capital Airport and to Shanghai, twice a day to Hong Kong, and twice a week to Guangzhou.

      Thailand has announced plans to screen all arrivals from China for symptoms of the coronavirus and confirmed six more infections among such visitors, taking its tally to 14, health officials said.

Thai tourist authorities meanwhile said the number of Chinese tourists to Thailand was expected to fall by 2 million to 9 million this year due to the coronavirus oubreak in China.

Thais were also advised to avoid non-essential travel to China, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary, told a news conference.

      China's president has told the visiting chief of the World Health Organisation he was confident of winning the battle against a "devil" coronavirus.
 
"The virus is a devil and we cannot let the devil hide," state television quoted Xi Jinping as saying.
 
"China will strengthen international cooperation and welcomes the WHO participation in virus prevention ... We believe that the WHO and international community will give a calm, objective and rational assessment of the virus and China is confident of winning the battle against the virus."


 
Mr Xi discussed ways to protect Chinese and foreigners in the area affected by the coronavirus with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, as well as "possible alternatives" to evacuations, a WHO spokesperson said.

      British officials estimate up to 200 UK citizens currently in Hubei province will want to return to the UK.
 
If they end up being flown home by the Foreign Office, health officials will also tell them to "self-isolate" for 14 days. If they are unable to stay at home, quarantine facilities will be provided, officials said.
 
Mr Hancock told MPs in the Commons he had directed Public Health England to take a "belt and braces approach". He said officials could not be 100 per cent certain the virus is not spread by people who are not displaying symptoms.

      More than half a million South Koreans have signed a petition calling for a ban on visitors from China as Seoul announced it would evacuate citizens from the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

A petition filed with the presidential Blue House last week had gathered more than 540,000 signatures by Tuesday, highlighting a growing fear in South Korea the coronavirus could spread.
 
"Coronavirus is spreading from China. Even North Korea is banning Chinese people from entering," wrote the anonymous author of the petition, adding that even a temporary ban would help stop the virus from spreading too widely.
 
The Blue House has not directly responded to the petition. When asked about other countries' bans on Chinese entries, its spokesman said only that the issue should be handled in close consultation with the World Health Organization.

The country's foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, said the plane departing Tokyo later today was set to return with about 200 people tomorrow morning.

He said Japan has been talking with the Chinese government about such arrangements as it explores "all possible options" to bring the Japanese people in Wuhan home.
