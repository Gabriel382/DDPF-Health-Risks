Face masks selling fast in South Canterbury 
 Empty racks where face masks would usually be stocked at Placemakers Timaru.

South Canterbury retailers have started selling out of face masks following the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, last week.

No cases have been reported in New Zealand, but those concerned about a possible outbreak here have been fast to act - clearing out all of the stock of face masks in at least three retail stores in the region.

Placemakers Timaru and Twizel joint venture owner/operator Brendan Leary said his customers were not prepared to take any chances with the store selling about 1000 masks since last week.

"We're sold out in both Placemakers Timaru and Twizel and have have ordered more stock, but suppliers have also run out.

Leary said signs advising they had sold out of masks had been placed at entrances to both stores.

"In the last couple of days sales have exploded since media reports have become more common."

Highfield Pharmacy pharmacist and owner Anna Bridson said tdemand for face masks had picked up in the past few days, and they were now restricting sales.

"What we had disappeared instantly and then it has taken days to get more stock," Bridson said.

"We did get more stock this morning but we have to sell it bit by bit."

Bridson said it would be difficult to order more stock.

"Maybe we were not as prepared as we should have been," she said.
