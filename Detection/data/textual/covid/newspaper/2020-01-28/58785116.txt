Copper extends rout as China virus death toll climbs 
 LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Copper fell to a three-month low on Tuesday, extending losses triggered by fears that a deadly virus in China could worsen and impact the top metal consumer's economy.

The virus, which belongs to the same coronavirus family as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), has claimed 106 lives as China stepped up preventive measures to limit its spread.

"There is still a high level of uncertainty about how severe this issue and how far it can spread so I think you will see some further price falls in the short term," said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann.

"But it's too early to say whether the virus will have an impact on real copper demand, at the moment its purely psychological," he said.

Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) fell for a 10th straight session on Tuesday, down 0.6% to $5,711 a tonne by 1116 GMT. The metal, often used as a gauge for economic health, touched its lowest since Oct. 17 at $5,706.

CHINA: Growth in China, which accounts for nearly half of global copper consumption, slumped to a near 30-year low in 2019, pressured by sluggish domestic demand and trade frictions with the United States.

Analysts say the virus could further weaken China, the world's second largest economy.

JAPAN REACTION: Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura warned that corporate profits and factory production might take a hit from the outbreak.

COPPER TECHNICALS: Technical relative strength index (RSI) on daily LME chart looks oversold and is back to levels not seen since July 2018, said Marex Spectron analyst Alastair Munro. Resistance sits between $5,850-$5,910.50 a tonne and below that, the next support into $5,665-96.

POSITIONING: The net speculative long in LME copper has fallen week-on-week to 2.5% of open interest or 5,100 lots as at last Thursday, according to broker Marex Spectron.

LEAD STOCKS: Headline or total stocks of lead in LME-approved warehouses grew by 600 tonnes to 66,800 tonnes, but was still near their lowest since July. 

LEAD SPREADS: This has pushed the premium for cash lead over the three-month contract to a near six-month high of $27 a tonne. 

DOMINANT POSITION: Exacerbating the tight situation was a large position accounting for 50-79% of available inventories, according to LME data. <0#LME-WHL>

SHFE: The Shanghai Futures Exchange said on Monday it would extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 and will reopen on Feb. 3, in line with the Chinese government's guideline to contain the outbreak.
