China reports 25 more deaths from coronavirus 
 China has reported 25 more deaths in the coronavirus outbreak as the toll rises to at least 106.

Authorities reported 24 deaths in Hubei province, where the virus first was detected in December, and one in Beijing, the Chinese capital.

The total number of confirmed cases has climbed to more than 4,200 worldwide.

The Chinese Government has locked down whole cities in Hubei, isolating some 50 million people in a sweeping anti-disease effort.

The US Consulate in Wuhan — the city at the centre of the outbreak — was preparing to fly its diplomats and some other Americans out of the country.

Japan, Mongolia, France and other governments also were preparing evacuations.

More to come.
