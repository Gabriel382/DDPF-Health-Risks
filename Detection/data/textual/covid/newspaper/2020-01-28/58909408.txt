Coronavirus: Latest Developments, What You Need To Know 
 CHICAGO (CBS) — Here are the latest developments on 
coronavirus:

The CDC on Tuesday warned Americans that they should not travel to China unless it was necessary.

Citing a reduction in passengers, United Airlines suspended 24 flights to three cities in China, including five operating at O’Hare (two flights to Beijing and three to Shanghai).

Federal health officials say there remain five cases of coronavirus in the United States, and all of them traveled from the Wuhan, China area, where the virus orginated. One woman is being treated at St. Alexius hospital in Hoffman Estates.  She is in good condition. The other cases are in California, Washington and Arizona.

Today, China agreed to let the World Health Organization send a team of experts to study the virus.  Among the tasks, the team will try to confirm whether the virus can spread from a person who does not yet show any symptoms.

As Chicagoans continued to stock up on surgical masks, CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said they only provide partial protection. 

“If it’s a droplet, there’s going to be virus in the droplets, so it will help protect it. But remember the virus is so small it can go through the mask,” he said.

Medical screening for the virus has expanded to 20 airports in the United States.  O’Hare was already on the original screening list.  Midway is not screening passengers as it has no flights coming from China.

Overall, the risk to Americans currently is low, federal health officials say.
