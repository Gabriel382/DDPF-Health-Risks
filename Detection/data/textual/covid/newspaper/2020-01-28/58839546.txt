Coronavirus-hit Thailand warns it’s ‘not able’ to stop disease spreading 
 The Public Health Minister of Thailand has warned that the country will not be able to stop the deadly coronavirus from spreading.

Thailand has the highest confirmed number of coronavirus infections outside China with 14.

But despite the Prime Minister reassuring locals the situation is under control, government officials have warned the virus will be able to be stopped from spreading throughout the country if the situation were to escalate.

The holiday destination is a top foreign destination for tourists from Wuhan and panic is starting to spread.

Anutin Charnvirakul, the country's Public Health Minister admitted to Sky News: "We are not able to stop the spread.

"Our target is we will be able to detect all carriers entering Thailand and we will apply necessary measures as the situation develops.

"Of course we expect more people to get sick but we are able to identify all of them."

The Prime Minister of Thailand had previously said the situation is under control but as the disease develops concerns are becoming a reality.

Thailand has been taking precautions with thermal scanners at the doors of luxury malls and attendants pumping disinfectant into the hands of visitors.

Residents have been advised to protect themselves with a focus on personal hygiene and isolation in doors.

But there is no way of knowing how many more infections will emerge in the coming days and weeks as China's death toll reached 101.

Six new cases were confirmed in China today, five of them involving a family from China's Hubei province, and the sixth from Chongqing province.
