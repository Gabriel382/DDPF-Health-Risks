‘Fake’ Qld Department of Health coronavirus warning a ‘racist’ hoax 
 Queensland Labor MP Duncan Pegg has rubbished a hoax coronavirus warning sent under the guise of the Department of Health advising people to avoid areas with large Chinese populations. The fake media release urged people to avoid “nonessential travel” to “all populated areas” where Chinese nationals make up a third of the population compared to "non-Chinese Australians" due to a “level three health warning” for the coronavirus.
