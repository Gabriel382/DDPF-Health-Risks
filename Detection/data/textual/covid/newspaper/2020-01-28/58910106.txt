Apple expected to post record holiday earnings: Live blog 
 Apple Inc. is expected to deliver record quarterly earnings and revenue Tuesday.

The report will detail Apple’s AAPL, +2.83%  performance during the crucial holiday period, which was the first full quarter of availability for the iPhone 11 family of devices as well as the first to include contributions from the Apple TV+ streaming service.

Though the March quarter is typically a quieter period for the smartphone company, Apple’s outlook for the current three-month stretch will be of more interest than usual, as it could reflect revenue from a lower-priced iPhone that a report says could hit the market in March. Management may also speak about what impact the coronavirus outbreak could have on China demand and the company’s Asian supply chain.

MarketWatch tech editor Jeremy C. Owens and reporter Emily Bary will live-blog Apple’s results, due to hit at 4:30 p.m. ET, and the subsequent conference call at 5 p.m. ET.
