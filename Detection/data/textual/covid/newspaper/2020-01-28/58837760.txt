Hotel sell-off seen as overdone 
 Bernstein warns that hotel RevPAR in China could fall as much as 47% Y/Y in Q1 due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Despite that huge RevPAR drop expectation, the firm sees a good entry point for investors to take a position in Marriott International (MAR ), Hilton Worldwide (HLT ) and Intercontinental Hotels (IHG ) due to outsized share price drops in relation to the contribution of China/Asia Pacific to the bottom lines of the hotel companies.
