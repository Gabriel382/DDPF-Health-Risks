Rescuing Australians stranded in virus city 
 The government is working with Chinese authorities to get Australians out of the Chinese city of Wuhan where the coronavirus outbreak originated and 56 people have died. At least 100 schoolchildren aged between six months and 16 years of age are said to be stranded in the city. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement “the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working closely with Chinese authorities and international partners to consider possible assistance with travel for Australians from areas that are affected by Chinese travel restrictions”.
