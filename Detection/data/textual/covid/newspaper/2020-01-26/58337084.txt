Marise Payne says Government trying to get Australian citizens out of Wuhan 
 Foreign Minister Marise Payne says diplomatic staff are working with Chinese authorities in an effort to get Australian citizens out of the Chinese city dubbed 'ground zero' in the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province have been put in virtual lockdown as the Chinese Government works to contain the spread of the new virus, which has so far killed more than 50 people.

"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working closely with Chinese authorities and international partners to consider possible assistance with travel for Australians from areas that are affected by Chinese travel restrictions," Senator Payne said in a statement.

"Given the circumstances of the spread of the coronavirus, Chinese authorities are currently imposing very tight restrictions on all travel from Hubei.

"We are seeking advice from the Chinese authorities on these restrictions and whether any options are available to international travellers."

The United States is also trying to evacuate its citizens from the city.

France is also trying to get people out of the region.
