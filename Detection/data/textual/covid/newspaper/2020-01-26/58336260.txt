CORONAVIRUS FACTSHEET: What you need to know 
 The deadly coronavirus outbreak that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has killed 56 people in China and infected about 2,000 worldwide.

On Saturday, Ontario government and health officials revealed Canada’s first “presumptive positive case” of coronavirus has been confirmed in Toronto — a man in his 50s who is being treated at Sunnybrook hospital.

WHAT: Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing but Chinese officials warn the virus is mutating and can be transmitted through human contact. Most affected are older people and those with health conditions.

CAUSE: It’s believed the virus came from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan, particularly the kait snake and Chinese cobra.

HOW IT SPREADS: Researchers believe each person infected passes the disease on to two and three others.

WHERE IT’S SPREAD: The vast majority of the cases are in mainland China but it has spread. Thailand has reported five cases; Australia has reported four; Singapore, France, Japan, Taiwan and Malaysia three; Vietnam, South Korea and the U.S. two each; and Nepal one.

PAST PANDEMICS: Some experts believe the virus is not another SARS rerun. SARS killed around 800 people around the planet. The 1918-19 Spanish Flu epidemic killed between 50 million and 100 million.

WHAT’S BEING DONE: Airports have ramped up screening; research teams are working on a vaccine; strict travel prohibitions have been enacted in China with many cities on lockdown; tourist sites have been shut; Lunar New Year festivities were cancelled.

WHAT’S NEXT: The World Health Organisation (WHO) said the outbreak is an emergency for China but is so far not a global health emergency.
