Fourth US case of coronavirus confirmed in Los Angeles County 
 The fourth case of the deadly coronavirus in the US has been confirmed in Los Angeles, health officials said Sunday.

The patient, whose identity was not released, was described as a returning traveler from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, NBC Los Angeles reported.

“There is no immediate threat to the general public, no special precautions are required, and people should not be excluded from activities based on their race, country of origin, or recent travel if they do not have symptoms of respiratory illness,” Los Angeles County Public Health said in a statement.

The case marks the second of the flu-like illness in southern California, where officials confirmed Saturday that there was a patient diagnosed with the virus in Orange County.

There were reports first confirmed last week of the coronavirus in Chicago and the Seattle, Wash. area.

The mystery illness can be transmitted from person to person and has killed in China at least 56 people.
