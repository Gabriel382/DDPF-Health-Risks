The Coronavirus: What Travelers Need to Know 
 “There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of Wuhan. If you’re not heading to those specific cities, you should be fine,” Dr. Alves said, referencing a growing list of cities in Hubei province covered by the travel ban.
He added that travelers should expect longer transit times, as there may be “health and temperatures screening at airports, railway stations, docks and long-haul bus stations.”
Dr. Alves also cautioned that travelers should reconsider travel to China if they are already sick with a cold or the flu. Within China, “some locations have implemented screening and travelers may face quarantine and testing,” he said. 
Are tourist destinations in China closed?
China boasts more than 55 UNESCO World Heritage sites, and some of the most popular, including the National Museum of China and the Forbidden City (both in Beijing), were closed over the weekend.
The Badaling section of the Great Wall of China, a popular attraction located some 40 miles outside of Beijing, was also closed, as were the Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Park (the hotels at the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort remain open). No date has been announced for reopening any of these sites. In addition, multiday celebrations for the Lunar New Year have been canceled in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Wuhan, at the center of the outbreak, lies on the Yangtze River. The river is a popular multi-night cruise route that includes visits to the Three Gorges Dam, which is in Hubei province. No official announcements on the status of these river cruises have been announced, however, travelers that have booked cruises should contact their travel agency
What precautions can travelers take?
“Those universal things like washing your hands are always recommended,” Dr. Alves said. He also suggested passengers avoid touching their faces, practice coughing etiquette and not cough into the environment.
