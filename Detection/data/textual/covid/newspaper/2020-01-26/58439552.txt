Patient with coronavirus remains in stable condition at Toronto hospital 
 Ontario health officials have announced that a "presumptive” case of a new coronavirus has been discovered in Toronto, which, if confirmed, would mark the first instance of the illness in Canada.



A man in his 50s tested positive for the new virus but secondary testing at Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory will take place to confirm the case.



The man recently travelled to Wuhan, China, which is believed to be the epicentre of the outbreak. The newly identified form of the virus has sickened more than 1,320 people and killed at least 41 in China, according to the World Health Organization.
