Coronavirus sparks concerns for $12b Chinese tourism 
 Tourism operators are concerned the coronavirus could deliver another blow to the nation's industry already struggling with the bushfire crisis. The Chinese government has banned all international group travel, forcing thousands of tourists to abandon their plans to visit Australia. The Australian reports about 1.4 million Chinese visitors come to Australia per year. About a quarter of that figure comes with tour groups, giving the economy a huge boost of almost $12 billion.
