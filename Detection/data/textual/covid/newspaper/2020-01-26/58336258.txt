OPH launches new webpage that locally tracks coronavirus 
 As health officials around the world continue to deal with the spread of the coronavirus, Ottawa Public Health is working to keep residents up to date with a new webpage. 


The page was launched Friday and includes all the latest local information, from the number of reported cases in Canada to how OPH is monitoring the infection.


As of Friday, the webpage says there are no reported cases of coronavirus in Canada or involving Canadians overseas. 


According to a memo sent out to city councillors Friday from OPH medical officer Dr. Vera Etches, OPH has been working with all levels of government, as well as all-hazards emergency preparedness partners that include first responders and the Ottawa Airport Authority and all neighbouring health units to share information and coordinate actions. 


 





 


"While it is important to take the situation seriously and to be prepared, the risk to Canadians and to Ottawa residents remains low," the memo reads. "OPH has created a webpage that includes updates on this evolving situation, health messaging for residents and partners, and links to domestic and international health authorities."


The memo also states that since the situation continues to evolve, residents can expect more information over the coming days.



Residents are advised to wash their hands often with soap and water, avoid touching their face, to cover coughs and sneezes and to stay home if they're sick. 


Anyone who has developed symptoms within two weeks of travelling to Wuhan, China, or has had contact with anyone who has travelled to the area are asked to call the hospital or medical clinic before arriving. 


A total of 846 cases of the virus have been reported globally, 830 of which were in China and one of which is in the U.S., the World Health Organization reported Friday.
