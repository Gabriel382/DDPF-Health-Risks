China warns coronavirus's ability to spread is getting stronger as it bans wild animal trade 
 China has banned wildlife trade nationwide in markets, supermarkets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The country's market watchdog, agricultural ministry, and forestry bureau said in a joint statement that any places that breed wildlife should be isolated. The transportation of wildlife should also be banned from Sunday.
This new coronavirus is thought to have originated in a market in the city of Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province.
Preliminary research suggests the virus may have been transmitted to humans from snakes, though medical experts have suggested other possible sources such as badgers and rats.
