Australians 'don't know what we're up against' with coronavirus threat 
 Writer Corrine Barraclough says she believes Australians “don’t know what we’re up against,” as newly confirmed cases of the deadly coronavirus are announced across the nation. It comes as six people have tested negative for the coronavirus in Queensland meaning there are no confirmed cases across the state. However, contact tracing has also taken place in relation to patients in New South Wales after the fifth case of the deadly virus emerged in Sydney on Sunday. A young Chinese woman had tested positive for the disease, as calls emerged for the federal government to take drastic measures to stop the possibility of the virus entering the country. Ms Barraclough told Sky News it must be “absolutely horrifying” for the families who have children currently trapped within the Chinese province of Wuhan as the city remains in a quarantine lockdown. However, she said, “we have to do the right thing here and the right thing is to not be spreading this terrible virus around”. Image: Getty
