A third case of the new coronavirus in the U.S. has been diagnosed in Orange County, California.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the case in a traveler from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the global outbreak.

Cases in China have soared to nearly 2,000 in recent days. A handful of other cases have been confirmed in other countries, including Australia, France, Japan, Singapore and Thailand.

Two other cases of the new coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, have been confirmed in the U.S., one in Everett, Washington, and another in Chicago. Those patients remain hospitalized, but are said to be doing well.

In a statement late Saturday night, the OC Health Care Agency said the patient is in good condition, and in isolation in a hospital. They declined to provide any more details about the person, but said the risk for spread in Orange County is low.

"There is no evidence that person-to-person transmission has occurred in Orange County," health officials wrote in the statement.

Doctors will monitor the patient's close contacts for at least 14 days for any symptoms of the virus. However, health officials said anyone who's had casual contact with an infected person — shopped in the same grocery store, for example — is at "minimal risk for developing infection."
