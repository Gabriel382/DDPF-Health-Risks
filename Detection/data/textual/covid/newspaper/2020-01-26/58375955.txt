In pictures: The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak 
 The deadly Wuhan coronavirus is spreading through Asia and across the world.

The illness was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, a major city in central China. Since then, sick travelers from Wuhan have infected people in China and other countries, including the United States.

Coronavirus symptoms can look like a common cold -- a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and a fever. But for those with a weaker immune system, the virus could cause more serious illnesses like pneumonia or bronchitis.

As officials race to slow the spread of the virus, containment efforts have been put in place in many travel hubs.
