9-month-old baby in China reported to have coronavirus 
 A 9-month-old baby is the youngest known patient infected with the deadly coronavirus sweeping across China, according to a report.

The baby girl was among the 68 coronavirus cases detected in Beijing since the illness emerged last month in the city of Wuhan, CNN reported.

The number of confirmed cases in the country climbed to 2,051 on Sunday with at least 56 deaths.

The mystery virus, which has no cure, broke out in December at a Wuhan market.

Health officials said while there is no vaccine, viruses can generally be prevented by washing one’s hands and by avoiding touching one’s eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, or coming in to close contact with people who are sick.
