20% of those infected could become severely ill: Expert 
 An estimated 20 per cent of the people infected with the Wuhan virus will become very ill, such as with more severe pneumonia, says a Singapore infectious diseases expert. That is the current estimate and this may change when more is known about the Wuhan coronavirus, also known as the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), says Dr Shawn Vasoo, the acting clinical director at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). With concerns growing, The Straits Times' Joyce Teo asked Dr Vasoo to explain what else is known about the virus.

A In some people, the virus infects the lower respiratory tract (lungs) and this results in pneumonia. Not everyone will get pneumonia but in most diagnosed cases so far, pneumonia, of varying severity, has been commonly described.
