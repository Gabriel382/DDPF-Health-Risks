Is coronavirus really the next 'Big One'? How worried we should be about the outbreak 
 Put on your face mask and batten down the hatches. A new virus is on the loose and, to judge by the smoke signals emanating from World Health Organisation headquarters in Geneva, it might be time to cancel those winter holiday plans.

Certainly, with 56 deaths reported in China, several cities under quarantine and more than 1,975 confirmed cases, including in Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia, this is no time to be boarding a plane to south-east Asia. Right now, around a thousand American citizens in Wuhan, a city of 11  million about 500 miles west of Shanghai, are preparing to be evacuated on a US government-charted flight.

But is this so-called “Wuhan flu” really the oft-predicted “Big One” – the start of a pandemic like the 1918-19 Spanish flu? Is that horseman on the horizon an outrider for the coming Apocalypse, or merely a reminder of pandemics past?

The fact is, no one knows whether the new coronavirus, which was first detected six weeks ago in Wuhan will prove as contagious as the Spanish flu, much less SARS, a related coronavirus which, in 2002 and 2003, sparked a major scare and the meltdown of Asian stock markets.

The good news, at present, is that the Wuhan virus doesn’t appear to be as catchy as SARS. And while it could become as virulent as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another type of coronavirus, so far that doesn’t appear to have happened. Indeed, reports coming out of China suggest that the virus is relatively stable.
