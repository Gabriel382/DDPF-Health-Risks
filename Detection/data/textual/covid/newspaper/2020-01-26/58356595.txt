California Confirms Coronavirus Patient, Marking Third U.S. Case 
 A person in Orange County, California, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus. 
It is the third confirmed case in the United States. The others involved a woman in her 60s in Chicago and a man in his 30s in Washington state.
The Orange County Health Care Agency, which received confirmation of the case from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the individual had been sent to a local hospital and is in “good condition.”
The patient is a traveler from Wuhan, China, and “there is no evidence that person-to-person transmission has occurred in Orange County,” according to the agency. “The current risk of local transmission remains low,” the agency said in a statement.
