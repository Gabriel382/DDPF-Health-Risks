 TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Two Indonesian airlines, Lion Air and Sriwijaya Air, have canceled eight flights between Bali and the Chinese city of Wuhan in the wake of the novel Coronavirus (nCov) outbreak."The flights stand suspended from January 23 to February 2," Communication and Legal Manager of PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) Arie Ahsanurrohim stated in Mangupura on Saturday.The flights were suspended on the basis of a notice issued by the International Notam Office Beijing as a precautionary measure against the spread of the deadly virus originating from Wuhan.The authority will update information on Beijing's notification over the closure of transportation in the city, Ahsanurrohim stated.China has imposed a travel lockdown on Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the outbreak that has claimed 41 lives and infected over 1,300 worldwide, as global health authorities prepare against a pandemic.Wuhan’s local government said it would shut down urban transport networks and suspend flights from 10 a.m. local time Thursday and urged residents to not leave, barring special circumstances."After Beijing revokes (the lockdown), automatically, the flights will also be reopened to serve passengers," he stated.Some 20 to 25 flights operate daily, from Bali to various cities in China, including three flights per week from the Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali to Wuhan.The number of Chinese tourists visiting Bali has reached 3,300 per day."Hence, it has become our focus, as we do not want this issue to affect tourism in Bali while we have to simultaneously prevent spread of the coronavirus in Bali," Ahsanurrohim added.ANTARA
