CDC confirms fifth case of coronavirus in U.S. 
 The CDC has found another coronavirus case in the U.S., this time in Arizona. With two other confirmed cases in California on Sunday, and a pair of prior cases in Illinois and Washington, this new finding marks the fifth person in America to be infected with the disease.According to the CDC, all five people with coronavirus have been hospitalized, and they all recently visited Wuhan, China, which is the epicenter of the outbreak. As of Sunday, over 100 people were under investigation by the CDC for possible having contracted the virus, and they expect that number to keep rising."(We're) getting calls all day, all night and that's what we want," director of National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Nancy Messonier told reporters. "We want people to have a high index of suspicion and call if they have a patient they are concerned about."The CDC is recommending that any Americans with plans to travel to Wuhan should not make the trip for the time being. Going forward, theyâ€™ll be releasing ongoing updates on the spread of coronavirus online on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
