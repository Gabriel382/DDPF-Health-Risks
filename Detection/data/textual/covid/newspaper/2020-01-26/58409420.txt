Visitor to OC tests positive for coronavirus 
 SANTA ANA (CNS) - The first case of coronavirus landed in Orange County Saturday night, as a traveler from Wuhan, China -- ground zero for the novel disease -- tested positive, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency.

That patient was taken to a local hospital and is in isolation in good condition, according to a written statement from the agency.

About 11 p.m., the agency announced that it's Communicable Disease Control Division received confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the case, and that the traveler "has been provided guidance to reduce exposure to the public while awaiting laboratory confirmation.''

In consultation with the CDC and the California Department of Public Health, the HCA said it was following up directly with all individuals who have had close contact with the person and are at risk of infection, and will be monitoring any close contacts and assure that proper evaluation and care is provided if someone becomes ill.

The CDC's guidance indicates that people who have casual contact with a case -- "in the same grocery store or movie theater'' -- are at "minimal risk of developing infection.''

It was not disclosed where and how the traveler entered into the country or into the county. The HCA said there is no evidence that person-to-person transmission has occurred in Orange County and that the current risk of local transmission remains low.
