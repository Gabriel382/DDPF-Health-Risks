Earnings could spark a significant pullback this week, long-time market bull Art Hogan warns 
 With the busiest period of earnings season kicking off this week, the National Securities chief market strategist warns conditions are ripe for a significant move lower.

"Stocks are relatively priced for perfection, and you tend to have a bit of an overreaction to bad news or in-line news when that happens," he told CNBC's "Trading Nation" on Friday. "My guess is if we're going to rationalize a market that's pretty stretched right here, it's going to happen right now."

Hogan sees fourth quarter results as the top risk to the record market rally â€” bigger than coronavirus fears and Mideast tensions.

"We have about a third of the S&P 500 reporting. We're going to see the losers lose a whole lot more than we've seen in a while," he said. "The index itself could probably pull back 3% to 5%."
