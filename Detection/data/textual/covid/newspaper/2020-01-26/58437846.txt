Corona virus in China - DER SPIEGEL - International 
 The bad news came at a quarter to eight on Thursday morning. I had just woken up in the hotel when the phone started ringing. “We have a problem,” said my colleague, Wu Dandan, who works in Beijing’s DER SPIEGEL office and had accompanied me to Wuhan. “The authorities are shutting down the city. Nobody will be allowed out after 10 a.m.”

That sort of news has a way of waking you up pretty quickly. Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, is considered to be where the new coronavirus originated. Most infections and deaths have been registered here, and the numbers keep rising. The virus is thought to have an incubation period of up to 12 days. If we don’t get out, I thought, we’ll be stuck at ground zero of the outbreak for days, perhaps even weeks. In quarantine.

We had arrived on Wednesday from Beijing to take a first-hand look at the situation in Wuhan’s hospitals, in the market, at the train station and at the airport. Because even as the virus was spreading here, hundreds of millions of people across China were preparing to celebrate Lunar New Year with their families. The event would set off a wave of travelers similar to the one at Christmas in Europe. And Wuhan is one of the country’s travel hubs. What happens to a city when it is forced to prepare for an epidemic – and maybe even catastrophe?
