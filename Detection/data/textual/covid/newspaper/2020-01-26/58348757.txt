China bans wildlife trade over coronavirus 
 China has banned the wildlife trade nationwide in markets, supermarkets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms due to the coronavirus outbreak, the country's market watchdog, agricultural ministry, and forestry bureau say.
Any places that breed wildlife should be isolated, and the transportation of wildlife should be banned, said the joint statement.
The ban will take effect from Sunday.
The virus which has infected more than 2000 people globally and killed 56 people in China has been traced to a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.
