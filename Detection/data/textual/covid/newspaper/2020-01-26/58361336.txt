Abe says Japan to evacuate its citizens from new virus-hit Wuhan 
 TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan will help all its citizens wishing to travel back to the country from the central Chinese city of Wuhan amid a deadly outbreak of coronavirus, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Sunday.

Abe told reporters that the government will arrange a charter flight or other means to bring them back from the city, where the virus was first identified, killing at least 56 people in China and infecting more than 2,000 globally.

"As soon as adjustments with the Chinese government get done, I will pursue all means and realize the return of all applicants," Abe said at his official residence.

As of Friday, there were about 710 Japanese citizens in Wuhan, according to the Japanese government.
