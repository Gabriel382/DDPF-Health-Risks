China is on a seven-day Lunar New Year holiday that started on Friday, a period when the amusement parks would be usually packed with tourists.

The country has confirmed 1,975 cases of patients infected with the new coronavirus as of January 25, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 56.

The virus originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei late last year and has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as to the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia, France and Canada.

Other tourists spots have been shut down, including Great Wall of China and Beijing's Forbidden City.

The Badaling section of the Great Wall, about 50 miles north-west of Beijing, draws thousands of tourists every day.
