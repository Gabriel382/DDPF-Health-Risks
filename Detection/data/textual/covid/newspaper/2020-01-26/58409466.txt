Chinese Lunar New Year parade in Paris canceled over coronavirus fears 
 Paris has canceled its Chinese Lunar New Year parade amid concerns over the deadly coronavirus outbreak, the mayor said Sunday.

Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said the parade planned for Sunday at Place de la République was scrapped as a precaution.

“I have met with the Chinese community in Paris. They are very emotional and concerned and they have decided to cancel the parade that was scheduled for this afternoon at Place de la Republique,” Hidalgo said on Europe 1 radio.

“We must not give in to panic but, at the same time, be vigilant and respect the decision of the Chinese associations in Paris.”

The decision came after three cases were confirmed in France of the deadly illness that originated in Wuhan, China.

All three cases reported in France involve Chinese nationals who were hospitalized, officials said. Two of the cases were in Paris, while the third was detected in the southwest city of Bordeaux.

Bordeaux on Saturday also canceled its planned Chinese New Year celebrations in order to prevent the virus’ spread, officials said. The move was also a gesture of support for victims in China, where 56 people have died from the flu-like affliction so far.
