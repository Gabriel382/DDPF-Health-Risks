Will the coronavirus outbreak knock global growth? 
 The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak spooked financial markets last week. Now investors are on high alert for economic repercussions.

The virus appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan last month and has since infected hundreds of people around the world, including three confirmed cases in the United States. The death toll in China has risen to more than 50.

"The rapid spread of the virus means there is no longer any doubt that it will disrupt the economy this quarter," Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said in a recent note to clients.

The outbreak is bringing back memories of SARS, a highly contagious virus that caused a global panic in 2003. The virus, which originated in China, infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774.
