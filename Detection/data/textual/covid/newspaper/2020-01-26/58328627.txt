NC Division of Public Health: Test results negative for coronavirus in patient from Triangle :: 
 — The North Carolina Division of Public Health says a patient from the Triangle who was being tested for the novel coronavirus is not infected with the virus.

Negative results were received Saturday evening from testing performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The unidentified patient was staying at Duke Hospital during the process after arriving at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on Thursday.

The unidentified person recently traveled to China and passed through Wuhan City, where the outbreak originated, but had not visited the seafood and animal market that was linked to many early cases, authorities said on Friday.

“We are pleased that test results were negative and that the patient remains in good health,” said Dr. Zack Moore, State Epidemiologist, in a press release Saturday night. “We are working with CDC and local partners to be sure we are prepared to detect and respond to any possible cases that might occur in North Carolina in the future.”

Coronavirus infections initially were diagnosed in Wuhan City, China and have since been reported in travelers from this city to other locations in China and other countries including the United States. No cases have been identified in North Carolina.

Travelers to Wuhan who develop a fever or respiratory symptoms, including cough and difficulty breathing, within two weeks of leaving should contact their doctor right away and should call ahead before going to the clinic, urgent care or emergency room so appropriate steps can be taken to avoid exposing others.
