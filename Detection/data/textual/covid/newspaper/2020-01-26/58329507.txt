Health chiefs try to play down coronavirus panic by comparing it with EBOLA 
 HEALTH chiefs tried to play down the panic by comparing coronavirus with other deadly outbreaks.

Casualty figures suggest that two to three per cent of carriers will die.

The fatality rate for Ebola was 70 per cent, rising to 90 in some areas.

Sars killed about ten per cent of victims.

A public health source said: “It’s clearly nasty but not so dangerous as Ebola and Sars.

"Everyone should take precautions and avoid infected areas but there is no need for alarm at this stage.”

Prof Robert Dingwall, of Nottingham Trent University, said it is impossible to stop the virus reaching the UK, and that it could infect Brits for years.

He added: “There are a substantial number of people with business or family ties to China travelling back and forth. We can only try to contain the cases as they arrive.”
