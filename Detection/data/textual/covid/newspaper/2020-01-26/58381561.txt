 MANILA - The Department of Foreign Affairs on Sunday said that the Philippine Consulate General in Shanghai "is already in touch with around 150 Filipinos in Wuhan City" which was the source of the viral outbreak that has already killed more than 50.

"As the city is on lockdown, the Consulate has requested Filipino community leaders to provide them assistance, especially to tourists or on short-time visit," the DFA said.

The DFA added that it is closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak in China through its Embassy and Consulates General.

It advises Filipinos in China to take necessary precautions and follow the advice from local health authorities in their areas.

The DFA said the Philippine Consulate General in Hong Kong has also issued an advisory urging Filipinos in the territory to cooperate with Hong Kong government, as it raised its response level to the highest "Emergency Response Level".

"Filipinos who will require assistance from the Consulate may be reached through its hotline at (+852) 9155 4023."

An emergency meeting will be held on Monday by the DFA's Migrant Workers' Affairs to discuss how to respond to the health emergency, the Department said.
