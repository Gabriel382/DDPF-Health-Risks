Coronavirus ability to spread ‘getting stronger’ says China 
 China is entering a ‘crucial stage’, the country’s health minister has declared – warning the ability of the coronavirus to spread was getting stronger.

56 people have now died and some 2,000 are infected – with yet more stringent travel restrictions in force.

The United States is preparing to evacuate its personnel in Hubei province – here the Foreign Office has urged any Britons in the area to leave if they can, with the idea of an airlift ‘under review’.
