 SHANGHAI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - China's coastal city of Shantou in Guangdong province, will not ban cars, ships and people from entering the city but will strengthen disease controls such as disinfection efforts, local state media STRTV reported, reversing an earlier government statement.

Earlier the city said it would stop cars, ships and people from entering the city starting on Jan. 27 to help prevent the spread of a coronavirus that broke out in Wuhan at end-2019. That announcement cannot be found now on Shantou city's website.

Shantou, which is more than 800 km (500 miles) from Wuhan city in central China, had also said earlier it would suspend the operation of buses, taxis and ferries from 2 p.m. on Sunday. (Reporting by Yilei Sun, Samuel Shen and Tony Munroe; Editing by Tom Hogue)
