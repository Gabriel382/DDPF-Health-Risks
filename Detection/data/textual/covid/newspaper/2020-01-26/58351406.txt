Wuhan virus: China says coronavirus ability to spread getting stronger 
 BEIJING (REUTERS) - China's National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said on Sunday (Jan 26) the transmission ability of the coronavirus behind an outbreak that has killed 56 people so far is getting stronger and that the number of infections could continue to rise.

Ma, speaking at a press briefing, also said authorities' knowledge of the new virus is limited and that they are unclear on the risks posed by mutations of the virus.

More than 2,000 people have been infected with the new coronavirus, the vast majority in China where 56 people have died from it.

The virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia, France and Canada.

President Xi Jinping said during a politburo meeting on Saturday that China was facing a "grave situation", as health authorities around the world scrambled to prevent a pandemic.
