WHO chief to meet Chinese government on coronavirus 
 The Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Sunday he would meet with the Chinese government and health experts supporting the coronavirus response.

Ghebreyesus said on his tweeter handle -@Dr Tedros – he was already on his way to Beijing to meet with the government and health experts working in that regard.

He said: “My WHO colleagues and I would like to understand the latest development and strengthen our partnership with China in providing further protection against the outbreak.

“We are working 24/7 to support China and its people during this difficult time and remain in close contact with affected countries, with our regional and country offices deeply involved.

“WHO is updating all countries on the situation and providing specific guidance on what to do to respond.

“Building on experience and systems already in place for the related pathogen, WHO has activated global networks of experts, quickly developed advice for countries everywhere and it is working with them to activate their response systems.’’

Meanwhile, the United Nations health agency said the risk of spreading the infection was very high in China, high at the regional level and moderate at the global level.

China has confirmed 1,975 cases of patients infected with the new coronavirus, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 56.

The virus originated from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei in 2019 and has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai.

It has also spread to the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia, France, and Canada. (NAN)
