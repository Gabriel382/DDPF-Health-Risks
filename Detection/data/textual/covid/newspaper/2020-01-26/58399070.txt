The third U.S. coronavirus patient in Orange County, California was a recent travel from Wuhan China, the disease’s epicenter.
The individual “is in isolation in good condition,” county officials said.
Two other U.S. cases have already been confirmed over the last week, one in Everett, Washington and the other in Chicago. 
Chinese officials have so far reported 56 deaths and 2,000 more confirmed cases as the virus continues to spread to other countries.
Ma Xiaowei, head of China’s National Health Commission, said Sunday he expects cases of the virus to surge because it is contagious during its incubation period—the period between when a person is infected and when symptoms present themselves.
