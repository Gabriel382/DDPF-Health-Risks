Wesleyan University student being monitored for coronavirus in Connecticut 
 A student at Wesleyan University in Connecticut is being monitored as a possible case of the deadly new coronavirus, school officials said.

The unidentified student complained of cough and fever after traveling through an airport where another person was identified to have the flu-like virus, the Hartford Courant reported.

“Out of an abundance of caution, we are working with the state Department of Public Health and the Centers of Disease Control to determine if the student has contracted the coronavirus or not,” spokeswoman Lauren Rubenstein said in a statement. “No diagnosis has been confirmed yet.”

The Middleton college said the patient is being isolated and officials have notified everyone “with whom the student had close contact since returning to campus in order to monitor them.”

The university wouldn’t say where the student is being treated, citing their privacy, the outlet reported.

There have been three confirmed cases in the US of the flu-like virus, which emerged in Wuhan, China, last month.

The illness — which can be transmitted from person to person — has killed 56 people, all in China, and sickened around 2,000 more, health officials said.
