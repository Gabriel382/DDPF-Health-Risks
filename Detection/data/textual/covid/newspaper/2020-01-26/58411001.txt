China: Coronavirus is getting stronger and infections could rise 
 China has warned that the ability of the deadly Coronavirus to spread is getting stronger and it can be passed on before any symptoms show.



Nearly 2,000 people have now contracted the virus in China alone. 56 have died. 



In Beijing, the reopening of nurseries, schools and universities has been delayed to help contain the outbreak. And in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the crisis, travel by car has now been banned. 



Sky's south east Asia correspondent Siobhan Robbins reports from the region.
