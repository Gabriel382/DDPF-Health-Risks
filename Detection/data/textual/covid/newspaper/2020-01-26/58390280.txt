Middle East Stock Markets Fall as Coronavirus Spreads: Inside EM 
 (Bloomberg) -- Most Middle Eastern equity gauges dropped at the start of the trading week, following losses in global markets on Friday as the coronavirus emanating from China spread.

Saudi Arabian stocks fell the most among Gulf peers. Energy giant Aramco traded at its lowest level on a closing basis since its listing in Riyadh during the session but pared some of the losses at close. The world’s most profitable company dropped 0.4% to 34.30 riyals.

“There might be more to this downward trend” globally, Ali Malik, an investment adviser at Bank of Singapore Ltd., said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Sunday. But past viral outbreaks have shown that “as soon as the new instances stop getting reported, we see a bounce back,” he said.
