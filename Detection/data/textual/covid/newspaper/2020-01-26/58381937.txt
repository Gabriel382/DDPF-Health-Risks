Doctor treating coronavirus says outbreak in Europe is 'extremely' unlikely 
 A doctor treating two patients for coronavirus in Paris has said the chances of a European epidemic are low.

Officials in France reported three confirmed cases of the virus on Friday, two in Paris and one in Bordeaux, which are the first recorded in Europe.

The two in Paris are a couple aged 30 and 31 from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak first began.

Dr Yazdan Yazdanpaneh said: ‘This illness is a lot less serious – and we don’t say this based on two patients, but talking to our international colleagues – than, for example, Sars.’

He added that the likelihood of an epidemic in France or Europe is ‘weak, extremely weak’.

The infected couple arrived in France on January 18 without symptoms, doctors said.

One of them started developing symptoms the next day and the other quickly followed.

They are now both being kept separately in specially equipped rooms at the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital.

Dr Yazdanpaneh noted that both patients are doing well, but could not say when they would be released from hospital.

He added that cases imported from China are ‘not a surprise’ and said France had prepared by developing a test that provides rapid results for suspected cases.

Today the Chinese President Xi Jinping shut down public transport and gatherings across the nation, as medical staff are rushed to the city of Wuhan.

He warned that the virus had accelerated, with the death toll now rising to 56.

Meanwhile nearly 2,000 cases have been confirmed, and there are another 2,600 suspected cases.

All of the known deaths from the virus have occurred within China.

Cases of the virus have been found in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the US, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France, Australia and Canada.
