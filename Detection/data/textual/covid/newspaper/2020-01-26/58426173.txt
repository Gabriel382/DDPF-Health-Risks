Arizona college student diagnosed as fifth US coronavirus case 
 An Arizona college student was confirmed to have the new coronavirus strain — the fifth case of the deadly bug detected in the US, officials said.

The patient, who wasn’t identified, is a student enrolled at Arizona State University in Tempe, news station KNXV reported.

Health officials said the student doesn’t live in university housing and they’re working to “identify any close contacts that may have been exposed while the person was infectious.”

“Any individuals who have been identified as having been exposed will be contacted directly,” officials said. “These individuals will be monitored for fever and respiratory symptoms in collaboration with public health and the university.”

It’s unclear how the student contracted the illness and whether they had traveled abroad to China, where the outbreak began in the central city of Wuhan.

The report marked the third confirmed coronavirus case in the US over the weekend. There have been two patients diagnosed in Orange County and Los Angeles County, California, after each made trips to China.

Health officials first confirmed cases of the coronavirus last week in Chicago and the Seattle, Washington area.
