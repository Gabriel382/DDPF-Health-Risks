The man had traveled to Wuhan and recently returned on a flight back to Toronto.The man fell ill and contacted 911, eventually arriving at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center on Thursday evening with fever and respiratory symptoms, according to a statement from the hospital.Officials said Saturday that the paramedics had been wearing full protective gear when they picked him up, and other members of his household were being "self-isolated."It's unclear how many other people would have come into contact with the man, but officials said it was highly unlikely that anyone on the man's flight — apart from those sitting closest to him — would have been exposed to the virus.So far, 42 people have died from the coronavirus outbreak, and roughly 1,370 people across the world have been infected.The virus is believed to have originated at a Wuhan wet market, and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States, Australia, France, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.Read more:Transit going in and out of Wuhan, China is being shut down to contain coronavirusUK public health officials are searching for 2,000 people who flew from Wuhan after coronavirus reached EuropeThe US government will reportedly evacuate its diplomats and citizens from Wuhan on a chartered plane amid the coronavirus outbreakThe Wuhan coronavirus has killed 42 people and infected nearly 1,300.
