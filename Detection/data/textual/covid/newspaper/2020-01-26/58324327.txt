China battles coronavirus outbreak: All the latest updates 
 The death toll in the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has risen to 54 authorities in the worst-hit province of Hubei said on Sunday, as China stepped up efforts to contain the infection and President Xi Jinping warned the country was facing a "grave situation". 

Officials in Hubei also reported 323 new cases, which would bring the number of infections nationwide to 1,610 based on figures released previously by the central government.

The respiratory illness remained centred on Hubei's provincial capital of Wuhan, home to 11 million people, which accounted for seven of the new deaths and 46 of the new confirmed cases, the Hubei Health Commission said.

China has stepped up travel restrictions, in effect sealing off Wuhan and more than a dozen other cities, curbing the movement of some 56 million people amid fears that the transmission rate will accelerate over the peak Lunar New Year travel season.

Health authorities around the world have stepped up screening at airports and other entry and exit points in an attempt to prevent a global pandemic as the virus continues to spread, with cases reported in Australia, France, the United States and seven countries in the Asia Pacific beyond China.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged that the respiratory illness, which has been traced to the city of Wuhan, is an emergency in China but the organisation on Thursday said it was too early to declare it a global health emergency.
