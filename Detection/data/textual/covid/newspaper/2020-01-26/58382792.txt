A Royal Marine recruit has died following an accident during a training exercise on a beach.

The Marine was taking part in an exercise on Tregantle Beach in Cornwall on Tuesday evening (January 21) when he is believed to have got into difficulties.

Emergency services were called and he was airlifted to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon, but on Saturday the Royal Navy confirmed he had died.

A Royal Navy spokeswoman said: “We can confirm the sad death of the Royal Marine who was injured in an incident earlier this week and we now ask for a period of grace for the family.

“The thoughts and sympathies of the Naval Service go out to the family and friends of the individual.

“The incident is still under investigation, therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further.”

It is understood that the name of the recruit will not be released by the MoD for at least 24 hours, and only with the permission of his family.

According to The Sun, the exercise involved the recruits bailing out of an assault boat when the marine got into difficulties.

On Thursday, South Western Ambulance Service said it was called to an incident on Tregantle Beach at 10.01pm on January 21.

A spokesman said: “The caller reported to us that a person had gone underwater. We sent land, air and other specialist paramedics to attend the incident”

“They treated a male patient at the scene and he was conveyed by air ambulance to Derriford Hospital for further care.”
