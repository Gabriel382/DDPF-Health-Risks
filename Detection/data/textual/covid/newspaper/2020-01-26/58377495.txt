SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China may “appropriately” extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus outbreak, a working group meeting hosted by China’s premier Li Keqiang said on Sunday, state broadcaster CCTV reported. 
The working group said it may adjust the date of schools returning following the holiday, support telecommuting and take other measures to reduce the flow of people, CCTV added. 
The Lunar New Year holiday began on Friday but has been seriously disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak.
