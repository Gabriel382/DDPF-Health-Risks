No changes to be made to OPH's coronavirus response plan 
 Ottawa Public Health says it will not be making any changes to its coronavirus response plan following the announcement of Canada's first presumptive confirmed case of the virus.


The Ontario government released a statement Saturday night after they had been made aware of a Toronto man who had recently returned from Wuhan, China and was showing symptoms.


Following the announcement, Dr. Vera Etches, OPH Medical Officer of Health, tweeted that OPH had been preparing for the possibility of cases in Canada. 


 





 


The patient was brought into Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre by paramedics and was quarantined. As a precaution, his family was also put into isolation. 


According to a series of tweets by Canada's Chief Public health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam, health authorities and providers across the country continue to monitor the situation and investigate any incidents that may present concern. 


 





 


The risk of an outbreak, Tam says, is low. 


If there is a suspected or confirmed case of the virus in Ottawa, OPH says it would work with the Ministry, Public Health Ontario Laboratory and local hospitals to manage the case and any contacts. 


Residents are advised to wash their hands often with soap and water, avoid touching their face, to cover coughs and sneezes and to stay home if they're sick. 


Anyone who has developed symptoms within two weeks of travelling to Wuhan, China, or has had contact with anyone who has travelled to the area are asked to call the hospital or medical clinic before arriving. 


Common symptoms include fever, cough and respiratory issues like shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.
