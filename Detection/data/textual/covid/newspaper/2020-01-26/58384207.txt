When does Chinese New Year 2020 end? 
 Chinese New Year, or the Spring Festival, kicked off on January 25 – with celebrations taking place all over the world to mark the new year according to the traditional Chinese calendar.

The date of the festival, which goes on for several days, changes every year which means the date of the end of the festivities changes right along with it.

You’d therefore be more than forgiven for wanting a reminder of how long Chinese New Year goes on for and when it will end in 2020.

Here’s what you need to know…

The date of Chinese New Year, aka Lunar New Year, changes ever year because the Chinese New Year is based on the lunar calendar rather than the Gregorian.

It begins on the new moon that rises between 21 January and 20 February in the Gregorian calendar, and ends roughly 15 days later on a full moon.

In 2020, the Chinese New Year festival will end with the culmination of the Lantern Festival on February 8.

The Chinese Zodiac is based on a 12-year cycle determined by the Chinese lunar calendar.

Each year in a cycle is assigned an animal sign – the signs are Rat, Ox, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Tiger, Rabbit, Sheep, Rooster, Monkey, Dog and Pig.

2020 will be the Year of the Rat.

Those born under the Year of the Rat are believed to be quick-witted and resourceful, and they get along best with Oxes, Rabbits and Dragons, and the worst with Roosters and Horses.

The next Chinese New Year will begin on 12 February 2021, and it will be the first Year of the Ox since 2009.

Those born in the Year of the Ox are said to be strong, determined and conservative, and they get on best with those born under the Year of the Rat, Rooster and Monkey.

Meanwhile they are the least compatible with Tigers, Horses and Goats.
