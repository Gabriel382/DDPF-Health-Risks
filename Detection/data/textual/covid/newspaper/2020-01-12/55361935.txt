Beijing, Jan 9 (Prensa Latina) Chinese experts identified a new strain of coronavirus as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia that is affecting the central city of Wuhan, where 59 cases have been reported, including eight seriously-ill patients, local media reported on Thursday.

According to China Central Television (CCTV), the experts obtained the genome sequence of the virus on Tuesday and continue their research. 



 The virus is thought to be less aggressive than that which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but even so, scientists are working against time to discover how it is transmitted, as the peak travel season will start in China on Friday, due to the Lunar New Year festivities.
