US plans to evacuate Americans from Wuhan amid coronavirus outbreak 
 The US government is moving to evacuate citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan, which is paralyzed by a massive virus outbreak.

The government is arranging a charter flight Sunday to get citizens and diplomats out of the epidemic-stricken city, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The number of people in China infected with the coronavirus now tops 1,300, according to the Global Times, an English-language Chinese news outlet.

At least 41 people have died in Wuhan, which has a population of 11 million. It has sickened at least two people in the US and three people in New York are being monitored.


Roughly 1,000 American citizens are thought to be in Wuhan, and the US consulate there is reaching out to the ones it knows about to offer them a seat on the plane, the Journal said.

The plane can carry about 230 people, and will include diplomats from the consulate. The consulate will close temporarily.

US medical personnel will be aboard the Boeing 767 jet to make sure the virus doesn’t spread further if any of the passengers are infected.

It couldn’t be learned where in the US the plane would fly to.
