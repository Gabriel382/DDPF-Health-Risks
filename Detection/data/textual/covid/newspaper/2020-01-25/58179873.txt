 Pak boxers to get extra month for training

KARACHI: National boxers will get an extra month for training as the Asian and Oceania boxing qualifiers for 2020 Olympics have been postponed due to outbreak of corona virus in Wuhan, China.
The qualifiers were slated to be held from February 4-14 in Wuhan. "Yes today we have received an email from the IOC task force, making it clear that the event has been delayed until March 3," Pakistan Boxing Federation (PBF) secretary Col Nasir Tung told The News on Friday.
However he was quick to add that the decision about the venue is yet to be taken. Nasir said that it was a blessing for their boxers as they would get one month extra time to prepare for the tough competitions.
"We were all set to sending boxers. On January 20 we had received an email, a form of green signal and today it has been confirmed that the qualifiers have been delayed but where these will be held now will be known in few days," the official said.
A dozen of top boxers of Pakistan have been undergoing training at the Army Sports Complex in Rawalpindi since the start of this month under the AIBA 3-star coach Arshad Hussain. Arshad Hussain told The News on Friday that the delay was really a good one for them. "We are very happy as we got enough time for preparation now. The boys are fit and in a couple of days they will be sent to their homes so that they could bring their security clearance certificates from their respective areas' police stations. Its one of the requirements for China visa now," Arshad said. He said he would revise his plans now how to work further on the boys. After featuring in the continental qualifiers Pakistani boxers also will have another opportunity of qualifying for Olympics in the shape of world qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.
