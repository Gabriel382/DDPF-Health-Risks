Coronavirus in Australia: what we know 
 * Australia's first confirmed case of coronavirus is a Chinese national in his 50s who tested positive in Melbourne on Saturday morning, after arriving on a flight from Guangzhou on January 19.

* Five people in NSW and five people in Queensland are awaiting test results while authorities have already cleared two people in NSW and four in Queensland.

* China says the death toll has risen to 41, while more than 1000 people are now believed to have contracted the virus across 11 countries.

* Symptoms of the respiratory illness include fever, cough, sore throat, vomiting and difficulty breathing.

* Australia has raised the travel alert level to "do not travel" for the city of Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei province.

* Passengers arriving on all flights from China are being stopped and provided with health information including what to do if they become unwell.

* Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that part of China, there is no need for current concern.
