Japanese airline crews to wear masks to prevent coronavirus infection 
 NARITA, Chiba -- Flight attendants with All Nippon Airways Co. (ANA) and Japan Airlines Co. (JAL) began using face masks on flights connecting Japan to China and Hong Kong on Jan. 24 in response to the new coronavirus breakout that apparently began in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

ANA and JAL explained that cabin crews are wearing masks "to provide safe services for customers" among other reasons. Spring Airlines Japan Co., a low-cost carrier based at Narita International Airport, has also instructed their flight attendants to wear masks on routes to China, as part of efforts to prevent infection.

As Wuhan Tianhe International Airport has been shut down, ANA and Spring Airlines have cancelled flights connecting Narita Airport, east of Tokyo, and Wuhan.

Ground crew at some check-in counters, information service staff and store clerks at Narita Airport have also started using masks. Keisei Electric Railway Co. employees working at Narita Airport Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 stations are wearing masks as well.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has requested airline companies to make announcements during flights arriving from China instructing passengers "who have a cough, fever or other symptoms to report it to a quarantine officer," and to hand out papers with instructions relating to the coronavirus.

The virus has killed more than 40 people in China. There had been two cases of infection reported in Japan as of Jan. 24.
