Coronavirus spread ‘accelerating’, says President Xi 
 China’s president has warned the spread of the deadly coronavirus is accelerating, as he convened a special meeting of Communist leaders.

The country is also taking yet more drastic measures aimed at bringing it under control, including strict travel restrictions during the country’s biggest holiday – the Lunar New Year.

The Chinese military are sending hundreds of staff to the epicentre of Wuhan and rushing in more medical supplies.
