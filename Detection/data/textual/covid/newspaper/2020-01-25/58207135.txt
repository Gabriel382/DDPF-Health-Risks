Coronavirus outbreak: Japan confirms third case, death toll in China rises to 41 
 Japan has confirmed a third case of infection by China's coronavirus, the health ministry said on Saturday.

The latest case was confirmed in a woman in her 30s who lives in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak. She arrived in Japan on Jan. 18, the ministry said.

The death toll from China's coronavirus outbreak jumped on Saturday to 41 from 26 a day earlier. More than 1,300 people have been infected globally, highlighting the challenges for health authorities around the world working to prevent a global pandemic.

The Health Commission of Hubei Province said in a statement published early Saturday that 180 new cases had been reported as of end-Friday, putting the total number of confirmed patients in the province at 752.

Just three of the 41 deaths took place outside China's Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.

This is nearly a 60 per cent jump from the previous death toll, that was 26, The New York Times reported.
