Ontario health officials say first 'presumptive' case of coronavirus confirmed in Toronto 
 A 'presumptive' case of the coronavirus in Canada has been confirmed in Toronto, Ontario health officials say.


	Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams says the patient is a male in his 50s who travelled from Wuhan, China.


	He was admitted to Sunnybrook hospital.


	The new coronavirus, known as 2019-nCov, has killed at least 41 people as of Saturday.


	



	The disease was first reported by health authorities in Wuhan, China on Dec. 31. Since then, the number of infected has climbed to 1,287.


	Australia and Malaysia reported their first cases Saturday - four each -and Japan, its third. France confirmed three cases Friday, the first in Europe, and the U.S. identified its second, a woman in Chicago who had returned from China.


	The new virus comes from a large family of what are known as coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. It causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath. It can worsen to pneumonia, which can be fatal.


	More to come.
