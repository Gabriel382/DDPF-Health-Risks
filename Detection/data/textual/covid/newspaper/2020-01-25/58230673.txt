As if Deadly Coronavirus Wasn't Enough... Potentially Dangerous Asteroid to Fly Past Earth Next Month 
 An asteroid under the designated number 163373 and with an estimated diameter between 440 and 990 metres will fly past the Earth in February, NASA said.

Asteroid 163373 was discovered on 23 October 1995 and was put in the Apollo group of asteroids that fly through the Earth's orbit, that's why they're considered potentially dangerous.

The asteroid will pass near Earth again in 2075.
