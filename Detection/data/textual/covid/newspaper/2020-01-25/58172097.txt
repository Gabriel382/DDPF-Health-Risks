The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report 11 patients in the U.S. have been tested for Coronavirus, including a patient in Northern Colorado. The patient had a travel history to Wuhan, but the test results came back negative.

Two patients have tested positive for the virus in Chicago and Seattle. Authorities believe the virus, which causes flu-like symptoms, moved into the human population from an infected animal at a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

“While there is public health concern, the health risk from 2019-nCoV (novel Coronavirus) is low,” said Deanna Herbert with CDPHE. “Just as we recommend for other respiratory viruses, the best way to remain healthy is by washing your hands and staying away from others who are ill.”
