Coronavirus case confirmed in Victoria 
 Ms Mikakos said the risk of transmission remained low but Victorian and commonwealth officials would be stationed at Melbourne Airport and a hotline would be set up for people to get information about coronavirus.
Every passenger on the manâ€™s flight will be contacted by health authorities in the coming days, she said.
"This is a evolving situation. We are now one of eleven countries who have confirmed cases," Ms Mikakos said.
"I do want to stress... there is no reason for alarm in the general community. We have had flu epidemics in the past, including SARs and our system is geared up well to deal with this situation."
The man has pneumonia and is in a stable condition, she said. Hospital staff treating him are wearing masks, gloves, and gowns while treating the man in an isolated room in the Monash Medical Centre.
