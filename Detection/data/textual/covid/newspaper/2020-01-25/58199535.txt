Wuhan virus: Man on Scoot flight from Singapore to China sent for further tests, all passengers isolated 
 SINGAPORE - A passenger from a flight by Singapore Airlines' budget arm Scoot that departed from Singapore to China yesterday has been taken for further tests, in a bid by authorities to prevent the further spread of the Wuhan coronavirus.

In a statement on Saturday (Jan 25), Scoot said that a passenger on flight TR 188 had to be sent for further blood tests after the flight landed in Hangzhou, China on Friday.

All 314 passengers on the flight have been isolated at the airport until the blood test results are released. It is not known how many Singaporeans were on the flight.

Upon landing at Hangzhou International Airport, all passengers on the flight had to undergo "enhanced health screening", said Scoot, adding that passengers sent for blood tests had to go for additional screening as well.

"All passengers and crew of TR188 24 January 2020 have been isolated at the airport until the blood test results are out," said a Scoot spokesman.

While the crew of flight TR188 had to be isolated, the plane made a return trip back to Singapore after it was disinfected, added the spokesman.

Due to this, the returning flight TR189 was delayed by more than six hours. It was scheduled to depart Hangzhou at 11:15pm on Friday but only took off at 5:30am on Saturday.

"TR189 customers were provided with refreshments during the delay," said the Scoot spokesman.

"There are disinfectants, hand sanitisers and masks available on all Scoot flights for use by passengers and crew if required."
