Wuhan virus: US plans to evacuate its citizens from Chinese city due to outbreak 
 WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - The United States is arranging a charter flight on Sunday (Jan 26) to bring its citizens and diplomats back from the Chinese city of Wuhan, epicentre of the outbreak of a new coronavirus, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.

The plane, with around 230 people, will carry diplomats from the US consulate as well as US citizens and their families, the Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the operation.

Washington was given approval for the operation from China's Foreign Ministry and other government agencies following negotiations in recent days, the newspaper said.

The US also plans to temporarily shut its Wuhan consulate, it said.
