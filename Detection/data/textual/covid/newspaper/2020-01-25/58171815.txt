Brit given all clear from coronavirus says he 'felt like ET' during isolation 
 A BRITISH artist kept in quarantine with suspected snake flu for two days has told of his relief at receiving the all-clear.

Mr Hope said: “I felt like ET. It was totally bonkers.”

Michael Hope, 45, spent 18 months teaching art in Wuhan, where the coronavirus started.

He flew back to Newcastle on Sunday and was isolated on Wednesday.

Tests have since revealed he had seasonal flu.

Health officials then sent medics in biohazard suits to take him to hospital.

He was placed in a sealed room with air locks.

Tests came back negative on Thursday evening and Michael said he was “flooded with relief”.

But he added: “I feel sad for my friends there and everyone else who can’t just jump on a flight like I had the privilege of doing.

“I feel sad for China having to deal with this, but I feel frustrated that markets that keep live animals are not properly regulated.

He did not get checked for symptoms while traveling because he flew home from Shanghai.
