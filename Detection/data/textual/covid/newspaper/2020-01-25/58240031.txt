Indian Student Escapes Coronavirus In Nick Of Time, While His Brother Is Still Stuck In Wuhan 
 In China’s Wuhan city, which is the epicentre of the Coronavirus outbreak, close to 1,200 Indians are enrolled as Medical students. To say that their parents, back home in India, are worried, is an understatement.
A student from Delhi named, Dev Kumar, was lucky enough to escape the pandemic - he left for India a few weeks ago to visit his parents. While his folks are relieved that he is home, they are still worried about their the younger son, who is stuck in China.

 Speaking to Edex Live Dev Kumar said, “I got to know about the outbreak only about four weeks ago. This was a pre-planned vacation. My parents keep on telling me how lucky we are. I got to go home at the right time.”

 “We're constantly calling my brother and making sure that he's taking all the right precautions to stay safe. He's a chef and has booked his tickets to come to India by mid-February,” Dev added.

 "I hope to go back at that time, even though my parents are asking me not to go back at all," says Dev worrying about his career. According to reports, China is one of the most preferred destinations for higher education for Indian students, after the USA.
 Indians who choose to go overseas for a medical degree, mostly go to China — which is why most of the Indian students are studying in Wuhan. 
 The Indian Embassy has issued an advisory to the residents in China, "If you feel sick on the flight while travelling back to India: Inform the airline's crew about illness, seek mask from the airline crew, avoid close contact with family members or fellow travellers,” the advisory said.
 According to the latest reports, the death toll in the deadly coronavirus has climbed to 41 with confirmed cases rising sharply to 830, mostly in China's Hubei province.
