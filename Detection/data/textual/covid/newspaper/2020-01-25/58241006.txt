The tech sector steps into the bright lights this week with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all due to report during a heavy week of earnings reports. The tech giants are largely seen needing to top earnings and guidance expectations to shoot higher in the near term following a blistering few months of share price gains. Near the end of the week, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) will do the heavy lifting for the industrials sector and Exxon Mobile (NYSE:XOM) steps out for the energy industry, while UPS (NYSE:UPS) will issue its state-of-the-economy assessment. There will also be riveting updates from Boeing (NYSE:BA) on the 737 Max and plans for the 787 Dreamliner, as well as Altria (NYSE:MO) on its Juul (JUUL) investment. Blazing-hot Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also report in the week ahead and could potentially deliver some news on the Model Y to go along with its 2020 guidance. Across the Pacific, the Shanghai Stock Market is closed all next week for the Chinese New Year holiday and the Hong Stock Market is shut down on January 27-28.

China: The impact of the Wuhan coronavirus on China and perhaps the global economy will be a major focus next week as more updates pour in. The outbreak has already negatively impacted companies like IMAX (NYSE:IMAX), Yum China (NYSE:YUMC), Disney (NYSE:DIS), McDonald's (MCD), Luckin Coffee (NASDAQ:LK), China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA), China Southern Airlines (NYSE:ZNH) and a large number of energy and travel stocks. Efforts to contain the Wuhan virus are overlapping the important Chinese New Year holiday period, which means Macau casinos could see reduced traffic and lower gross gaming revenue for Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), Galaxy Entertainment (OTCPK:GXYEF), SJM Holdings (OTCPK:SJMHF), Melco Resorts & Entertainment (NASDAQ:MLCO) and Studio City International (NYSE:MSC). Meanwhile, the list of healthcare names that have a spotlight on them as the virus is assessed includes Co-Diagnostics (NASDAQ:CODX), Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), NanoViricides (NYSEMKT:NNVC), Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), ImmuCell (NASDAQ:ICCC), Aethlon Medical (NASDAQ:AEMD), Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:INO), BioCryst Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:BCRX), Nabriva Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NBRV), Alpha Pro Tech (NYSEMKT:APT), iBio (NYSEMKT:IBIO) and Lakeland Industries (NASDAQ:LAKE).

FOMC meeting: The Fed meets for the first time of the year on January 28-29. The central bank is expected to hold rates after Fed officials signaled at the last meeting that they plan to keep interest rates unchanged for a while. The new rotation of voting FOMC members for 2020 includes Neel Kashkari (Minneapolis Fed), Robert Kaplan (Dallas Fed), Loretta Mester (Cleveland Fed) and Patrick Harker (Philadelphia Fed). "Weâ€™re likely to see a slightly more dovish-leaning committee this year," says BMO Capital's Sal Guatieri of the new lineup. Despite the lack of rate drama at next week's meeting, traders will still be watching Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference very closely to see how the FOMC plans to maneuver during an election year. Another area of focus will be the Fed's expansion of its balance sheet, which data suggest has supported cyclical and financial stocks at the expense of defensive sectors like utilities and telecommunication.

IPO watch: Annovis Bio (ANVS) is expected to price its IPO on January 28, while Black Diamond Therapeutics (BDTX) and Avadim Health (AHI) are set to price in January 29. The biggest pricing of the week will be the $1.5B Reynolds Consumer Products (REYN) IPO on January 30. The household products seller generated net income of $135M off revenue of $2.2B for the first nine months of 2019. 1Life Healthcare (ONEM) and Arcutis Biotherapeutics (ARQT) are also due to price their IPOs on January 30. Also of note, IPO share lockups expire on Borr Drilling (NYSE:BORR) on January 27, as well as Dynatrace (NYSE:DT), Kura Sushi USA (NASDAQ:KRUS), Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) on January 28 and BioCardia (OTCQB:BCDA) on January 29.
