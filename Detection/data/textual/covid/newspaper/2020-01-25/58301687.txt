Governments across the world are on high-alert amid an outbreak of a new form of viral coronavirus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was first reported in late December. According to the latest official data, more than 1,300 people have been infected, with 41 people dying as a result of contracting the virus.

The so-called Wuhan coronavirus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses that caused SARS - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which also originated in China in 2002 and resulted in the deaths of about 800 people all over the globe.
