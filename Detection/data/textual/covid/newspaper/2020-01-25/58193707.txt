India's women boxers may spar with foreign partners to prepare for Olympic qualifiers - Times of India 
 NEW DELHI: The postponement of the first Olympic qualifier, which was originally scheduled in Wuhan but had to be moved out due to coronavirus outbreak, has created problems for the Indian women boxing ’s coaching staff, apart from disrupting the schedule of elite women boxers in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics.However, looking at the positives, the rescheduling of the Asia/Oceania qualifier to fresh dates of March 3 to 11 at a venue yet to be decided, has offered a window of opportunity to Indian coaches and boxers to prepare the team for a full extra month, apart from inviting women pugilists from other countries for an international training camp in India.A similar camp is currently underway for the elite men’s team in Bellary, Karnataka where boxers from Australia and Italy were practising.Chief women’s coach, Raffaele Bergamasco , informed that he has spoken to his counterparts in French and Russian boxing federations with a request to send their teams to train alongside Indian boxers preparing for the qualifier in five Olympic weight categories. A similar request would also be made to the Italian federation.Bergamasco said he will write to the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) after getting a feedback from nations he has approached.“Boxers from France are ready to come. We are awaiting response from the Russian federation. Italy is another good side which we are looking at. Once I get the confirmation, I’ll write to the federation. There’s a possibility that we (Olympic category boxers and coaches) may travel to any of these locations for a training camp ahead of the qualifier,” Bergamasco told TOI.The coach added that since the Asia/Oceania and a separate European qualifier will take place within close distance of each other, boxers from France and Russia would also be looking for strong sparring partners. The European qualifier will take place from March 11 to 23 in London.However, the postponement has brought its own set of problems. First, a scheduled visit of women boxers to Colorado Springs in the USA next month, for which the visa process had already been initiated, would now have to be either cancelled or rescheduled. The rescheduling also means there’ll be little time left between two qualifiers in March and the other one in Paris in May.
