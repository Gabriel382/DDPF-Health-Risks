Two possible cases of Coronavirus not far from the Valley 
 More reason to be concerned about the Coronavirus. The CDC confirmed a second case in the U.S. Friday.

Two people from the Twin Cities are also being tested, both were recently in China.

With the recent news, health officials are on the lookout for additional cases.

"We of course consider any new infectious disease as a serious concern and we are taking precautions," Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm says.

A fast response is key. The most important thing, according to health officials, call ahead if you are experiencing symptoms.

"That alerts the health care facility and their personnel. We don't want these individuals just showing up to a health care setting," Michelle Dehtloff with the North Dakota Department of Health says.

Once a case is reported, lab samples are sent to the CDC to be tested and confirmed. This could take several days.

Pending results, patients will be held in isolation. The CDC has guidance on home-care isolation, depending on the situation.

"We may have to work out where that person can be because we are not going to want to expose other people," Dehtloff says. "More than likely, they are going to be hospitalized."

The two people from the Twin Cities are being held in isolation in their own homes.

People who have traveled and are symptom free have no restrictions at this time. They can go to work, go to school and be in the community until the CDC says otherwise.

"What we know today about this virus and other viruses from the same families suggests that this is really a low immediate risk for the general public," Malcolm says.

Given the growing numbers regarding the flu, health officials also urge you to stay at home when sick, cover your mouth when coughing and wash your hands.
