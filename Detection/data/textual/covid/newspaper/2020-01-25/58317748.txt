        If you haven't heard, the virus reportedly starting breaking out in China first -- but, as we mentioned, there've been some folks within our borders that have contracted it.

    
  

        
        Supposedly, it mimics a cold at first ... and then turns into a full-blown respiratory infection. And, if you're unlucky, it might even kill you.
