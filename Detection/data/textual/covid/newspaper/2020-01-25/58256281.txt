When is Chinese New Year 2021 and what is the animal? 
 It’s Chinese New Year 2020, which means it’s time to say goodbye to the Year of the Pig and hello to the Year of the Rat.

The Chinese Zodiac is based on a 12-year cycle determined by the Chinese lunar calendar, with each year in a cycle related to an animal sign.

As we ring in this Chinese New Year, here’s what you need to know about what next year’s aminal will be.

The next Chinese New Year will begin on 12 February 2021.

That year will be the Year of the Ox – the first one since 2009.

Aside from the Rat and Ox, the other animals are Dragon, Snake, Horse, Tiger, Rabbit, Sheep, Rooster, Monkey, Dog and Pig.

Those born in the Year of the Ox are said to be determined, strong and conservative.

Their best matches are those born under the Year of the Rat, Monkey and Rooster.

Meanwhile they are the least compatible with Tigers, Horses and Goats.

Those born under the Year of the Rat are believed to be quick-witted and resourceful.

They get along best with Oxes, Rabbits and Dragons, and the worst with Roosters and Horses.

The date of Chinese New Year, aka Lunar New Year, changes because, unlike the traditional Western New Year celebration which sees us celebrate on 31 December, the Chinese New Year is based on the lunar calendar rather than the Gregorian.

It begins on the new moon that rises anywhere between 21 January and 20 February in the Gregorian calendar, and ends 15 days later on another full moon.
