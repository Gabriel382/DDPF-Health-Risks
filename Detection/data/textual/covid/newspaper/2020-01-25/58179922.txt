Chinese authorities have encouraged people in Wuhan to wear surgical masks in public to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus . The question is: Do they work?Many disease specialists say the cheap disposable masks may help prevent the spread of infections if they are worn properly and used consistently. But "washing your hands and avoiding ill people is way more important", Dr Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said. Masks leave gaps around the mouth, "so you're not filtering all of the air that comes in," she said.The masks block most large respiratory droplets from other people's sneezes and coughs from entering your mouth and nose, said Dr Amesh Adalja of Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security . The bigger problem is that people don't use the masks properly.
