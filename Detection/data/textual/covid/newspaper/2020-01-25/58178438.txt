Govt classes travel to Wuhan ‘extremely dangerous’ 
 The government has raised its travel advice for Wuhan and Hubei in China to four — a level used when the security situation is “extremely dangerous” — as the coronavirus death toll rises to 41 and the number infected soars to more than 1,200. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australians should not travel to the region as they may not be able to leave until Chinese restrictions are lifted. One case of the coronavirus has been confirmed in Victoria. Five people are being tested in New South Wales for the virus while two others in Queensland are waiting for their results. The disease has been rapidly spreading across the world, including into Europe and the United States. China has expanded an unprecedented lockdown to 13 cities and at least 36 million people to try to prevent its spread. Image: Getty
