Australia infected as coronavirus toll jumps to 41 dead, 1,200 ill 
 Australia has joined a growing number of countries infected by the spreading coronavirus — with a Chinese national isolated in Melbourne marking the nation's first confirmed case. The man aged in his 50s had returned to Melbourne from Guangzhou on January 19 aboard a China Southern Airlines flight. Seven people in New South Wales and Queensland are waiting to find out if they are infected. The death toll from the virus which originated in Wuhan, China, has risen to 41 and infected more than 1,200 people globally. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said confirmation of the virus’ spread was “anticipated” and stressed “procedures” are “swinging into place to ensure we can provide the protection to Australians”. Victoria’s Acting Chief Health Officer Angie Bone said it’s “highly likely” more cases of the coronavirus will appear. The government has raised its travel advice for Wuhan and Hubei in China to four — a level used when the security situation is “extremely dangerous”. Image: AP
