Nurse bursts into tears at hospital on 'lockdown' during Chinese New Year 
 A nurse working on the 'frontline' trying to save patients from the deadly coronavirus has broken down in tears after realising she will have to spend Chinese New Year in hospital.

Footage taken inside what appears to be a communal rest room captures a hopeless nurse crying loudly as she yells: "I can't take this anymore!"

Her colleagues can be seen going over to comfort her while she cries her lungs out.

A group of five or six group nurses are seen sobbing quietly while having their food.

The video's caption reads: "While Xi Jinping is enjoying his good time at Chinese New Year, the nurses in Wuhan are going mental!"

As Wuhan remains a quarantine zone, doctors and medical staff at hospitals have to stay and help treat as much patients as they can.

The Wuhan flu, also known as coronavirus, has killed 41 people and infected over 1,300 people - including three in France and two in the US.

A former ENT doctor today died from coronavirus nine days after contracting it.

Dr Liang Wudong, 62, showed symptoms of tight chest and heart flusters before he was found to have a chest infection.

The deadly virus has already spread across 29 provinces and cites in China.

People online commented on the video, blaming the local government for neglecting the lives of medical staff.

One said: "Feels like it comes straight out of a parallel universe! Here they are saving lives, but the people are saving lives."

Another one described it as 'the feeling of being abandoned by the country'.

Others pay respect to the nurses and doctors for the hard work.
