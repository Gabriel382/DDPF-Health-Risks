Five tested for coronavirus in Queensland 
 Five people in Queensland are being assessed for potential infection of the deadly coronavirus, health authorities say.

The news follows four other people being tested and cleared across the state during the week.

Of the latest five cases, three were reported on Saturday on the Gold Coast.

It is understood that two of the trio may be part of a tourist group staying at Southport on the Gold Coast.

The other two people were reported previously and authorities have not provided details of their location.

Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young earlier urged anyone with symptoms of the respiratory disease to seek medical advice.

Australia's first confirmed case of coronavirus was declared in Victoria on Saturday.

The virus has already killed more than 40 people in China and infected upward of 1000 people around the world.
