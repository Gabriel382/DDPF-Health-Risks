 This is the market where officials say the coronavirus first jumped from animal to person. Known for selling exotic wildlife, the market is in the heart of Wuhan, a city of nearly 11 million people in the Hubei province.
The market — which was closed Jan. 1 — is about a half-mile from a large train station that connects the city to the rest of China.
