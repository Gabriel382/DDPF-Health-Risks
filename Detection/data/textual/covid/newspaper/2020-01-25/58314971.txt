Public health officials in Ontario call evening news conference 
 TORONTO — Top public health officials in Ontario say they will make an announcement later this evening.

The officials, including the province's chief medical officer, have called a news conference at 5:30 p.m. at the legislature.

They would not say if the announcement was related to the latest coronavirus outbreak.

The illness has sickened more than 1,200 people and killed at least 41 in China, the epicentre of the outbreak.

While no cases of the virus have been reported in Canada, public health officials have warned that might change soon.

Australia and Malaysia reported their first cases Saturday — four each —and Japan, its third. France confirmed three cases Friday, the first in Europe, and the U.S. identified its second, a woman in Chicago who had returned from China.
