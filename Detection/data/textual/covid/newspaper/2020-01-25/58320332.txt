NSW investigates two coronavirus cases 
 NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant says to speak to a doctor if you show coronavirus symptoms

Health authorities are continuing to investigate two cases of coronavirus in NSW while three men who have been diagnosed with the deadly viral infection remain isolated in hospital.

NSW Health on Sunday confirmed two coronavirus cases are under investigation, revised from four on Saturday.

Meanwhile, the three infected men, aged 35, 43 and 53, have been isolated in hospital to prevent the virus spreading further.

Two of the men had travelled to the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak - Wuhan - while another man had travelled from the southern city of Shenzhen but had direct contact with a person from Wuhan who was diagnosed with the virus.

Chief health officer Kerry Chant said anyone who has symptoms of the deadly infection should cover their coughs and sneezes with a tissue or their elbow and wash their hands thoroughly.

Dr Chant said people shouldn't be afraid of speaking to their doctors if they experience any coronavirus symptoms.

NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard also urged anyone with symptoms to come forward.

"Please be aware that we do now have coronavirus here in Sydney. If you've got symptoms, ask yourself whether you've come in recent weeks from China, particularly from Wuhan," he said on Saturday night.

Mr Hazzard said the state's health department had done everything possible to identify and contain the virus.

China has confirmed 42 deaths from the virus, while some 1300 people are now estimated to have the virus worldwide.

The illness has been confirmed other countries including Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, France and the United States.

Australians are being urged not to travel to Wuhan or China's Hubei province.
