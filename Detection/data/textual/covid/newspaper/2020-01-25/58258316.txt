Coronavirus live updates: Hong Kong to close schools for weeks as death toll rises in China 
 Across Hong Kong, where streets were quiet because of the holiday, almost everyone wore surgical masks. Some gyms have mandated temperature checks, and subway stations have erected signs advising passengers on public hygiene.

In 2003, Hong Kong was one of the worst affected regions by the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which killed 286 people including eight medical staff. Some medical experts and pro-democracy lawmakers have been urging the government to act more quickly and had been calling for transport links to Wuhan to be cut for over a week.

Yuen Kwok-yung at the University of Hong Kong, a microbiologist who played a key role in discovering SARS, warned Saturday that Hong Kong was facing its “last window of opportunity” to contain the spread of the disease, and urged everyone to wear surgical masks.

But the shutdowns and lockdowns are unlikely to prevent the disease continuing to spread around China and the world, experts said.

China has reported 1,287 confirmed cases of the virus, with the youngest a two-year-old girl in Guangxi province, and another 8,420 people under observation. But experts say the actual number of infections is likely to be much higher.
