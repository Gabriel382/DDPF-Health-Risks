Scientists race to develop vaccine to deadly China coronavirus 
 Scientists are racing to come up with a vaccine for a deadly new coronavirus that has killed at least 41 in China and sickened more than 1,000.

The project in the US is being spearheaded by the National Institutes of Health and the biomedical agencyâ€™s newly formed vaccine research group, Reuters reported.

Researchers are studying the genetic code of the virus, which was posted publicly by Chinese authorities shortly after the outbreak was confirmed in December.

The NIH is hoping to begin human trials for a potential vaccine in three months. In 2003, the agency took 20 months to move from gene sequencing to human vaccine trials for the deadly SARS virus.

The new coronavirus originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and has already spread around the world, with cases confirmed in Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Nepal, Taiwan, South Korea and the US.

No cases have been confirmed in New York City yet, but Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters Friday that city officials were bracing for the virus, saying it was a matter of when, not if.
