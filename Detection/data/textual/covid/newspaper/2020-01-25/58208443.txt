Parties unite over Taiwan's exclusion from WHO anti-virus planning 
 Taiwan's exclusion from World Health Organization meetings on the coronavirus outbreak has united the island's political parties, who normally agree on little, especially to do with China.  Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China, which considers it a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organizations as a separate entity.  Taiwan was not allowed to participate in an emergency WHO meeting on Wednesday about the new virus, which has killed at least 25 people since originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan last month.
