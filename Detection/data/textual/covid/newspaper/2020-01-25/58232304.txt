Coronavirus: A new global epidemic? 
 China is reporting that people with coronavirus outside the epicentre of the outbreak have now died.

This comes as health authorities around the world fear the infection rate could increase during what is usually China's busiest travel period of the year.

Hundreds of millions of Chinese are preparing to celebrate the Lunar New Year, although Beijing has cancelled all public celebrations. 

And as the death toll rises, more countries are taking their own precautions. So are these efforts enough?

And can the virus be contained quickly?
