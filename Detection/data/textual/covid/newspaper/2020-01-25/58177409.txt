BREAKING: First case of deadly coronavirus is confirmed in Victoria 
 A case of the deadly coronavirus has been confirmed in Victoria, Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said Saturday morning.

The infected person - the first to be confirmed in Australia - is a Chinese national in his 50s who last week returned from China.

Five people are undergoing testing for the virus in NSW and two in Queensland, with a number of people having already been cleared in both states.

People feared infected with the coronavirus are being turned away from clogged hospitals as more Australians are feared affected by the deadly infection.

Hospitals in the Chinese city of Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - are at capacity with at least 12 nearby cities and 36 million people being placed into lockdown.

One woman has travelled to multiple hospitals seeking urgent treatment for her sick husband, but was turned away from each one and forced to wait outside while he coughs up blood.

“People just keep dying, no one is taking care of the bodies. If this goes on like this, we will all be doomed,” the woman, named Xiaoxi, told The South China Morning Post.

The virus has already killed more than 40 people in China and infected upward of 1000 people around the world.

France has had three people test positive - the disease's first appearance in Europe.

Two cases, including a Chicago woman returning from China, have been confirmed in the United States.

Other than in Victoria, no more victims have been confirmed in Australia.
