Four tested for coronavirus in South Australia 
 Four South Australians are being tested for the deadly coronavirus. 
The outbreak started in China, where dozens of people have died and 36 million people are now in lockdown. The first Australian case has just been confirmed in Victoria.
The state Health Department is managing four cases but Communicable Disease Control Branch director Louise Flood said the likelihood the patients are actually infected was “low”.
“This afternoon SA public health clinicians, Department officials and the Minister for Health and Wellbeing Stephen Wade took part in a national teleconference with Commonwealth and state ministers and officials on the novel coronavirus response,” she said.
“For precaution, four people in South Australia are being tested for coronavirus – but the likelihood they have the condition is low.
“All required information on any SA links to confirmed interstate cases of coronavirus will be provided to SA Health to ensure immediate follow up and any further public health measures.
“We continue to work closely with the Commonwealth Department of Health and Health Departments in all jurisdictions to maintain a close watch on the situation.”
