Two 'probable' coronavirus patients in NSW 
 NSW health chief Kerry Chant has revealed two probable coronavirus cases in the state

Two "probable" cases of coronavirus have been isolated in Sydney after visiting the Chinese city at the centre of the deadly viral infection.

NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said the two men had recently travelled to Wuhan, a sprawling city in central China where the coronavirus outbreak began.

Authorities expected to have a definitive result for one of the men on Saturday night and the other by Sunday morning.

Dr Chant said the two men, one aged in his 30s and the other in his 50s, were not particularly unwell but were being kept in hospital as a precautionary measure.

"Those patients were admitted in the last few days for assessment," she told reporters on Saturday afternoon.

Four more people are being assessed for possible coronavirus infection in addition to the two probable cases, Dr Chant said.

"All of those cases have recently returned from China and all travelled to Wuhan," she said.

China has confirmed 41 deaths from the virus, while more than 1000 people are now estimated to have been affected worldwide.

Cases have been confirmed in 10 countries.
