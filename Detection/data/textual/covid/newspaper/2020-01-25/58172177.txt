One person isolated with possible coronavirus in Lakewood 
 St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood said Friday afternoon that a person who came in with a respiratory illness is being isolated in case the infection is a coronavirus, but it could just as easily be a seasonal flu.

Gianna Lisac, spokeswoman for St. Anthony, said the person is wearing a mask and staying in an isolation room out of an “abundance of caution.” The hospital is working with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment on next steps, but won’t have immediate confirmation of what the infection is, she said.

More than 1,000 cases of a virus that hasn’t yet been named have been identified, with the vast majority in China. Two cases have been identified in the United States, and both were in people who had recently traveled to Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, according to The New York Times. Chinese authorities have confirmed 41 deaths, mostly in older people, who are more susceptible to most respiratory diseases.


The newly identified virus causes flu-like symptoms, which can be caused by several more common bugs.

					
				

It’s not clear how lethal the virus may be, because people with less severe cases may not have sought treatment, and Chinese authorities may not have correctly identified all cases in the early stages of the outbreak.
