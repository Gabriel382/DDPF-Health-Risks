Coronavirus Fears Crippling Tourism Industry in Japan - JIJI PRESS 
 Tokyo, Jan. 25 (Jiji Press)--People working in tourism-oriented areas in Japan are increasingly alarmed as they are set to have throngs of visitors from China, where the Lunar New Year holiday period has started at a time when the country has been stunned by outbreaks of pneumonia caused by a new type of coronavirus. 

    "We can't close our shops. It can't be helped," Kazuo Sasaki, 69, an official at the Nijo Fish Market in Sapporo in the northernmost Japan prefecture of Hokkaido, said, while expressing concerns over growing risks of infection due to an increase in the number of visitors. The fish market is one of major sightseeing spots in the Hokkaido capital, which attracts over 300,000 tourists from China a year.

    At a Sapporo drug store where Chinese account for about 70 pct of customers, face masks and sterilization agents have been in short supply.

    The store now allows its staff workers to wear masks when serving customers, in order to protect their own health. "We want to sell products to as many people as possible," an official at the store said, with a sense of tension.

    A 20-year-old male university student working part-time at an eatery near Maihama Station of East Japan Railway Co. <9020>, or JR East, in Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, east of Tokyo, said: "I can't wear a mask when I serve guests. It can't be helped, but I'm scared." The train station is a gateway to Tokyo Disney Resort, which is flooded with tourists from abroad, including China, as well as Japanese visitors.
