Starbucks closes stores in China as coronavirus outbreak spreads 
 Starbucks has closed all stores in China’s Hubei Province amid the outbreak of deadly coronavirus in the capital of Wuhan, which has killed 41 people and sickened more than 1,300.

The coffee giant says the decision was prompted by the need to keep their customers and employees safe, Reuters reported.

McDonald’s has also closed stores in five cities in the province. Travel in the region has been severely restricted in an effort to contain the spread, according to Crain’s.

More than 60 million people live in Hubei province, with more than 11 million in Wuhan alone.

Two cases of the virus have been reported in the United States. Another 63 people in 22 states are currently being monitored for signs of coronavirus, according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
