Per The Times report, the move comes at a time when countries around the world have begun to implement procedures for scanning incoming travelers who could have come in contact with coronavirus. The Beijing city government has also prohibited buses that travel between various provinces, which as The Times reported, will limit travelers heading into the country's capital city from other parts of the country. Groups currently on tours abroad are allowed to proceed with their trips that are still in progress, The Times reported, though the association for China's travel agencies warned the groups to monitor their health for signs of the virus that has so far lead to 42 deaths across China.  Each of the 42 deaths has occurred within China's borders, though the virus has been spread worldwide with reported cases in 12 other countries, including Australia, Malaysia, Nepal, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, France, and the United States, per The Times.Vehicle traffic within Wuhan was restricted beginning at midnight local time Saturday in a move that prohibited vehicles from driving toward the city center. Travel in and out of the city has been restricted since Thursday. Read more: Hong Kong is shutting down its schools until February 17 to limit the spread of the Wuhan coronavirusTransit going in and out of Wuhan, China is being shut down to contain coronavirusThe US government will reportedly evacuate its diplomats and citizens from Wuhan on a chartered plane amid the coronavirus outbreakUK public health officials are searching for 2,000 people who flew from Wuhan after coronavirus reached Europe
