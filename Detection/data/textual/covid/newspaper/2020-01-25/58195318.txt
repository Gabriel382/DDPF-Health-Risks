Deadly coronavirus reaches Australian shores 
 Australia has joined a growing number of countries infected by the spreading coronavirus — with a Chinese national isolated in Melbourne marking the nation's first confirmed case. The man aged in his 50s had returned to Melbourne from Guangzhou on January 19 aboard a China Southern Airlines flight. Victoria’s Acting Chief Health Officer Angie Bone said it’s “highly likely” more cases of the coronavirus will appear. NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said there are six cases under investigation in her state — two of which are “probable cases”. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said confirmation of the virus’ spread was “anticipated” and stressed “procedures” are “swinging into place to ensure we can provide the protection to Australians”. The death toll from the virus which originated in Wuhan, China, has risen to 41 and infected more than 1,200 people globally. The government has elevated its travel advice for Wuhan and Hubei, in China, to four — a level used when the security situation is “extremely dangerous”. Image: Getty
