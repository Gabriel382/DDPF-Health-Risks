Even 90% Effective Vaccine Can Stop Outbreak of New Deadly Coronavirus - Professor 
 Although two Russian universities are already working on the development of a vaccine against a yet unknown type of the coronavirus, as the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor) earlier stated, the production could start in months, Professor of Medicine Alexander Lukashev has told Sputnik.

The researcher, who heads the Institute of Medical Parasitology, Tropical and Vector-borne Diseases, explains that the technical development of a vaccine usually takes several months because one needs to create a prototype.

According to him, nothing is hampering the development, pointing out that there are several ways to produce vaccines against this type of coronavirus. Each takes a different amount of time and varies in effectiveness and price. The scientist, who is not taking part in developing a vaccine, is sure, however, that even if it is not 100% effective, it is likely to be enough to stop the outbreak.

Earlier, Rospotrebnadzor head Anna Popova stated that some Russian scientists are working according to one algorithm, while others have opted for a different way, adding that many countries are engaged in this process.

The approach, called adenoviral, is “one of the most promising in the world”, Volchkov says. At the same time, he notes that the most effective approach is to make a virus, with the help of reverse genetics, on the basis of the 2019 coronavirus that is able to replicate only once. However, it has one major drawback – much time is needed.
