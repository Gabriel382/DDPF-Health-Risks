Malaysia confirms 8th case of Wuhan virus infection, no domestic transmission 
 KUALA LUMPUR – The number of 2019-nCoV infections in Malaysia increased to eight on Thursday (Jan 30) after a Chinese national was tested positive for the novel coronavirus that has killed at least 170 people in China.

Malaysia’s Health Ministry director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah said the latest incident involved an individual who was in close contact with the seventh confirmed patient, the Malay Mail news site reported.

All eight confirmed cases are Chinese citizens.

The eighth case is a 49-year-old woman who has been admitted to an isolation ward in Hospital Permai, Johor Baru, and is reported to be in stable condition, Datuk Dr Noor Hisham said in a statement.

Meanwhile Home Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Thursday that 14 people who had arrived in Malaysia on a flight were barred from entering the country after the Immigration Department learnt that they were from Wuhan.

“I have been informed that on Tuesday, 14 passengers from Wuhan had landed at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. They were then barred from entering and have been sent back,” said Tan Sri Muhyiddin, as quoted by The Star.

Last Saturday, Malaysia announced the discovery of its first three cases – three Wuhan tourists, who entered Malaysia via Johor Baru, from Singapore.

They are a 65-year-old woman and her grandsons, aged 11 and two. The woman’s 66-year-old husband, also from Wuhan, tested positive for the coronavirus in Singapore.

There were 10 confirmed cases in the Republic as of Wednesday.
