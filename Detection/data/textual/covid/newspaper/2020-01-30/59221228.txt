Man dies outside Haymarket restaurant 
 A man has collapsed and died of a suspected cardiac arrest outside a restaurant in Sydney’s Chinatown after bystanders reportedly failed to perform CPR out of fears he had coronavirus.
A NSW Police spokeswoman said officers were called to the Masuya Suisan restaurant on Campbell Street in Haymarket just after 8.30pm on Tuesday night “following reports of a concern for welfare”.
“Officers attached to Sydney City Police Area Command attended along with NSW Ambulance paramedics and commenced CPR on a 60-year-old man who is believed to have suffered a medical episode,” she said.
“Despite efforts to revive him the man died at the scene. There are no suspicious circumstances. A report will be prepared for the coroner.”
The spokeswoman would not comment on a report in The Daily Telegraph that bystanders refused to administer CPR due to coronavirus fears.
It comes after unconfirmed viral videos circulating on social media claim to show people believed to have coronavirus collapsing on the street in China.
There are now seven confirmed cases in Australia — four in NSW, two in Victoria and one in Queensland. There have been no deaths due to the virus.
The official death toll in China has now leapt to 170 with 7711 cases reported within the country. The outbreak has now spread to more than a dozen countries, with at least 91 confirmed cases outside China.
The World Health Organisation will reconvene on Thursday to determine whether outbreak constitutes a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern”.
