Tokyo Stocks Close Sharply Lower On Virus Woes 
 Tokyo stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday with investors discouraged by the further spread of the new coronavirus








Tokyo, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 30th Jan, 2020 ):Tokyo stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday with investors discouraged by the further spread of the new coronavirus. 
The benchmark Nikkei 225 index tumbled 1.72 percent, or 401.65 points, to 22,977.75, while the broader Topix index fell 1.48 percent, or 25.18 points, to 1,674.77. 
The stock market was already prone to drops in January after it rallied towards the year-end in 2019, noted Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities. 
"Then the new strain of the coronavirus came... We are bound to see negative impacts as the virus spreads," he told AFP, adding Chinese consumption and manufacturing activities would be affected. 
"Volatility will remain high in the coming month, with prices weighed down by investor caution over where the market will go." But Kagawa argued the market could turn up by March. 
"The market will likely calm down" thanks to solid economic fundamentals after the US-China trade deal and availability of investment money due to accommodative policies by central banks, he said. 
The World Health Organization on Wednesday warned all governments to "take action" over the deadly SARS-like disease.
