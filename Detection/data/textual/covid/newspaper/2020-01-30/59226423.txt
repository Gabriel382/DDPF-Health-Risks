The British government is advising against all but essential travel to China as the coronavirus outbreak that began in the central city of Wuhan last month continues to spread.

More than 100 people in China have died and the number of confirmed cases has reached 6,000. The virus, which has no known cure, has flu-like symptoms and can lead to pneumonia.

The Guardian’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, tells Rachel Humphreys that while the virus is not under control, there is currently no serious threat to people outside of Wuhan. But for UK citizens stuck such as Kathleen and Patrick who we find locked down in the Chinese city, there is an anxious wait as British officials plan an airlift out of Wuhan in the coming days.
