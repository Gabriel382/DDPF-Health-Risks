       WASHINGTON—President Trump announced a task force to address the fast-spreading coronavirus, which he said had been meeting daily since Monday.
 The task force is led by Health and Human Services Secretary 




      Alex Azar




       and will include national security adviser Robert O’Brien, Deputy Secretary of State 




      Stephen Biegun




       and Domestic Policy Council Director Joseph Grogan, among others. It also includes top experts on infectious diseases.
 Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Trump tweeted photos from what he said was a briefing on the coronavirus from government agencies, which he said were working closely with China.
