World Health Organization declares coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency 
 Much of China is on lockdown as the infection grows to 8,000 people; Benjamin Hall reports.




The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the new coronavirus outbreak a global emergency amid the recent jump in the number of infected patients.
"The main reason is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced at a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland.
An outbreak of the deadly virus-- which has killed at least 170 people as of Thursday and infected a total of 7,834-- was first reported by Chinese officials after it originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan.
Coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, is now said to be transferable between humans, and 38 new deaths and 1,737 new infected cases have been reported in the last 24 hours.

Roughly 99 percent of all cases of the virus-- 7,736 infected people--- have appeared in China but it has spread to at least 16 countries globally.
The United States currently has six cases of the virus: two in California, one in Arizona, one in Washington and two in Illinois, health officials said. The sixth case was confirmed Thursday in a Chicago resident, the spouse of the first confirmed travel-related case in Illinois. The new case marked the first in the U.S. that occurred via person-to-person transmission, CDC officials said.
Common symptoms of coronaviruses have resembled those of the common cold. Other strains of the virus such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) could cause pneumonia and possible death.
