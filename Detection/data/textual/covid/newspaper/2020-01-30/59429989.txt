First person-to-person transmission of coronavirus reported in the United States 
 The first case of person-to-person transmission of the new coronavirus has been confirmed in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The husband of a female patient with confirmed coronavirus in Chicago, Illinois tested positive for the virus. The risk to the general public in the US and in Illinois remains low, the CDC said in a press call today. 

“CDC experts have expected to identify some person-to-person spread in the US,” said CDC Director Robert Redfield. 

The new patient, the sixth case of confirmed coronavirus in the US, was being monitored by the Illinois Department of Public Health after his wife tested positive for coronavirus last week. She is believed to have contracted the disease during a recent trip to China. When her husband started experiencing symptoms, he was admitted to the hospital and placed in isolation. Both husband and wife are in their 60s and remain hospitalized. Public health officials are tracking his close contacts, and Illinois currently has 21 patients under investigation. 

The two patients were in very close contact for an extended period of time, and health officials believe that the female patient was symptomatic when she passed on the virus. 

This is a developing story and will be updated.
