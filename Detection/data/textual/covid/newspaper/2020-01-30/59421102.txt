Dalio said fears of the spreading coronavirus have triggered a “flight-to-quality market action” that continues to pressure stocks while giving a lift to hedges such as gold GC00, +0.65%  , bonds and the dollar DXY, -0.15%  .

At last check, the Dow DJIA, -0.36% was down double-digits, with the S&P SPX, -0.47% and Nasdaq COMP, -0.47% both firmly lower as well. Gold, seen as a safeguard against equity pullbacks, was building on recent advances.

“We want to pay attention to what’s actually happening, what people believe is happening that is reflected in pricing (relative to what’s likely), and what indicators that will indicate the reversal,” wrote Dalio, who’s made more money for his clients since 1975 than any other hedge fund, according to Bloomberg.

Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Dalio told CNBC in an interview that investors should be buying this market, rather than sitting on the sidelines. “Get out of trash,” he said. “There’s still a lot of money in cash.”
