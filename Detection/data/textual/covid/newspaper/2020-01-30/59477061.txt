Turkish Airlines says it suspends flights to China until Feb. 9 
 ISTANBUL, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Turkish Airlines is suspending its flights to mainland China after the World Health Organisation said it was declaring the coronavirus outbreak in China a global emergency, the company's CEO said on Friday.

Bilal Eksi said on Twitter that flights scheduled for four destinations in China - Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Xian - had been cancelled until Feb. 9, taking into the account the latest decision by the WHO.
