7000 in cruise ship virus lockdown 
 About 7,000 people were stranded on board a cruise ship in Italy on Thursday after the vast liner was placed on lockdown over two suspected cases of the deadly coronavirus.
A husband and wife from China have been put in isolation on the Costa Smerelda, after a couple came down with a fever and breathing problems.
The ship is currently docked in the port of Civitavecchia, near Rome. It is carrying 6000 tourists and another 1000 members of crew.
Samples from passengers have been sent for testing after a 54-year-old woman from Macau came down with a fever.
Test results are due this afternoon.
The other passengers barred from leaving the ship until they come back.
Costa Crociere confirmed the ship was in lockdown. It said it a 54-year old woman from Macau “was placed in solitary confinement in the on-board hospital last night with her travel companion”, and was following instructions from the health ministry.
The Costa Smeralda, the company’s flagship and the fifth-largest cruise ship in the world, “came from Palma de Mallorca and is currently engaged in one-week cruises in the western Mediterranean,” it said.
The couple flew in to Milan from Hong Kong on January 25, before getting on the cruise, according to Italian media reports.
“The couple’s cabin has been isolated and they are in with the doctors,” an unnamed passenger was quoted as telling ANSA news agency.
“We’re a bit worried of course. No-one is getting on or off the ship apart from the doctors. This holiday risks ending in a nightmare”.
China reported its biggest single-day jump in novel coronavirus deaths on Thursday, as global fears deepened with at least 15 countries confirming infections.
The World Health Organization, which initially downplayed a disease that has now killed 170 in China, was preparing to meet Thursday to decide whether to declare it a global emergency.
