Report: LPGA cancels March event in China over virus fears 
 The LPGA Tour has canceled the Blue Bay LPGA event on China's Hainan Island due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, Golfweek reported Thursday.

The tournament was scheduled for March 5-8, immediately following the HSBC Women's World Championship in Singapore.

The event was not held in 2019 due to its transition from the fall calendar to the spring schedule.

Mexico's Gaby Lopez captured her first LPGA title at Blue Bay in November 2018.

At least 170 people have died and more than 8,100 cases of the virus have been confirmed in mainland China, according to CNN.
