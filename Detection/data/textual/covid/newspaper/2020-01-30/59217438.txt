 China’s first coronavirus hospital opens after just 48 hours of construction

HUANGGANG: It took just two days for 500 workers to construct China's first dedicated coronavirus hospital in Hubei province and two more are expected to open in Wuhan - ground zero for the outbreak - within days.
China has opened its first coronavirus hospital after around 500 workers and volunteers spent just 48 hours converting an empty building. The medical building had been set to open in May, but following the deadly outbreak, it was all hands on deck to get it completed. It now boasts 1,000-beds and the first batch of coronavirus patients were transferred at around 10.30 pm last night. The hospital, called the Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Centre, in Huanggang, also has water, electricity and internet, reported international media on Wednesday.
It is expected to relieve some of the pressure on doctors and nurses in Hubei province - the epicentre of the outbreak - where overwhelmed hospitals were running out of beds, masks and other supplies as they were inundated with patients.
