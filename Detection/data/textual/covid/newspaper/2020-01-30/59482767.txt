Do Those Face Masks Really Protect You From Coronavirus? 
 While it’s unclear whether the masks actually work, there’s a reason why they’re used in hospitals. At the very least, any mask will help reduce the amount of times your touch you face – and that alone can potentially make a big difference – at least until scientists can better understand the impact and prevention of this new infection. But for now, it’s perhaps just as important to 
practice good hygiene, wash your hands properly and frequently, while limiting contact to the face, nose, and eyes.
