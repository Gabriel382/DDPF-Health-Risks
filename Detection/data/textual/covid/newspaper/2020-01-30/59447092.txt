LONDON (Reuters) - Virgin Atlantic has suspended its daily operations to Shanghai for two weeks from Feb. 2 due to the outbreak of coronavirus and a declining demand for flights, it said on Thursday.  
“Flights to Hong Kong continue to operate as scheduled,” it said. 
British Airways has cancelled all its flights to mainland China for a month.
