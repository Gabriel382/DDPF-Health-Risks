Avoid travel to China: Government advisory 
 NEW DELHI: With China reporting more cases of Novel Coronavirus (nCoV), India revised its travel advisory on Wednesday, asking people to refrain from travelling to the neighbouring country. Earlier this week, ministry of health and family welfare had advised people to avoid non-essential travel to China. “In view of a spurt in Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) cases being reported from China and travel-related cases appearing in many countries, the travellers to China are advised to avoid all non-essential travel to China,” the advisory issued by the ministry said. This has been revised to say, “Please refrain from travelling to China.” Indian carriers operating flights to Southeast Asia have asked pilots and cabin crew to wear N95 masks and take all other precautions. With more cases being reported from China, Indian carriers have also cancelled flights. IndiGo will suspend its Delhi-Chengdu daily from February 1 to 20 and the Bengaluru-Hong Kong flight. The airline, which has three daily flights to China, is also ensuring its crew does not have a layover in China and flies back to India on the return flights. About 27 samples have been tested at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s National Institute of Virology laboratory in Pune. All have been tested negative. Ayush ministry has also issued preventive advisory based on Indian traditional medicine practices of ayurveda, homeopathy and unani. Central Council for Research in Homeopathy discussed ways to prevent Coronavirus infection through homeopathy in a meeting of its advisory board on Tuesday. A group of experts recommended homeopathic medicine Arsenicum album 30 to be taken as a prophylactic medicine against the virus.
