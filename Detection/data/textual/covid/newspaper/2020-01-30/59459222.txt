US evacuees from China held at base 
 Nearly 200 Americans flown from China in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak have arrived at a US military base in California, where they will remain isolated for at least 72 hours of medical evaluation.
The group, mostly US diplomats and their families, were taken from Wuhan at the epicentre of the outbreak aboard a US government-chartered cargo jet that stopped to refuel in Alaska on Tuesday night before flying on to March Air Reserve Base, east of Los Angeles.
Foreign governments have begun flying their citizens out of Wuhan as the death toll has risen and the city has entered into a virtual quarantine, with Chinese authorities trying to contain the virus.
The 195 passengers at March air base were medically screened by Chinese government and US State Department officials before boarding the plane in Wuhan and again during the refuelling stop by a team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC officials said on Wednesday.
All the passengers have agreed to remain voluntarily in special housing at the military base, cordoned off from base personnel, for 72 hours.
None of the arriving passengers has so far exhibited any signs of illness such as fever, cough or other respiratory symptoms, the officials said.
One individual on the original evacuation manifest was barred from boarding the plane in China because the person had a fever.
The State Department ordered its personnel evacuated from the US Consulate in Wuhan and welcomed other American citizens onto the flight because there was excess room on the plane, CDC officials said.
The group included an unspecified number of children, ranging from a month-old infant to teenagers, they said.
