Supermarkets, Subway Stations and Residential Condominiums Conduct Rapid Tests to Identify Infected in China 
 Brazilian engineer Cindy Amaral Saikawa, 31, lives in Shenzhen, China, at least a thousand kilometers away from Wuhan, the epicenter of the Chinese coronavirus. But her routine has changed dramatically in recent weeks.

"Our temperatures are being measured at subway stations, in supermarkets and even in our building, by the doorman. If you have a fever, you are already taken directly to the hospital," she said.

Supermarket shelves empty more quickly than they are filled. Meat rots in boxes on the market floor. Hygiene products, alcohol, and protective masks last less than an hour on the shelves, she said.

"This week, the markets didn't have food, mainly without perishable products. People started to stock up on food and the markets were unable to supply the demand. The government even sent a communiqu√© asking people not to stock up on products and that everything would be supplied normally. But we no longer find rubbing alcohol or masks for sale, "she said.

Guangdong province, where Shenzhen is located, has 249 confirmed cases of infection with the new coronavirus but has not reported deaths. As of Wednesday (29), Chinese officials had reported more than 6,000 cases and 133 deaths.
