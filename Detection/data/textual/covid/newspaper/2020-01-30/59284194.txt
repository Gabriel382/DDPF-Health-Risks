Christmas Island 'is not Spartan' 
 Sky News host Peter Gleeson says the sensible way to respond to the threat of the deadly coronavirus is to “follow the advice from health authorities”. There is criticism surrounding the coalition’s plan to use facilities on Christmas Island as a quarantine centre for Australian evacuees from Wuhan. “We have to ensure we take a zero-tolerance approach to try to keep this under control” Mr Gleeson told Sky News host Peta Credlin. “It is not Spartan” said Sky News host Chris Smith and expressed disbelief that anyone trapped in Wuhan would have “second thoughts about going down to Christmas island”.
