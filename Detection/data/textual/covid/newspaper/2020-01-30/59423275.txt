'Don't be fooled': Sara Duterte warns vs 2019-nCoV hoax statement 
 MANILA - Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte on Thursday warned the public "not to be fooled" by people or groups identifying themselves as her uploading posts about the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

This, after a profile in Linkedin -- an online platform for professionals -- claimed to be Duterte that said she will temporarily ban travelers from China, where the 2019-nCov outbreak started.

The false statement went viral on social media even as netizens clamored for the travel ban, after the health department confirmed the first case of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines on Thursday.

"We call for sobriety and ask the public to stop spreading misinformation, which could only aggravate the situation," Duterte said in a statement.

The daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte said she only has an Instagram account, and she doesn't "own any other social media accounts anymore."

"We release official statements through official platforms and channels," she added.

A 38-year-old Chinese woman from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, was confirmed to be infected with the virus following a laboratory test in Australia.

The woman arrived in Manila via Hong Kong on Jan. 21. She is now in a government hospital in Metro Manila.
