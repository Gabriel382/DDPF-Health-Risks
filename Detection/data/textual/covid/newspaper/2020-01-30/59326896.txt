Crude oil futures down 1.39% on rise in US inventory, coronavirus economic impact 
 Crude oil futures slipped 1.39 percent to Rs 3,753 per barrel on January 30 as participants increased their long position as seen by the open interest. The fall was triggered by a rise in US inventories by 3.5 million barrels for the week-ended January 24 and fears that the increasing spread of coronavirus could have on global economic growth.

Fears of the virus impact on oil demand are increasing as major airlines cancelled or reduced direct flights to China and travel advisories issued by different governments led to drop in the number of passengers.
