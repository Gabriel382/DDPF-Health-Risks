Gov't to Offer $5 Million Aid to China 
 The Korean government said it is reviewing the possibility of sending US$5 million of humanitarian support to Beijing to help it fight the outbreak of coronavirus.

The Foreign Ministry here earlier announced that two Korean civic organizations will fly in some 2 million masks and medical relief items to China.

On top of the 250 personnel dispatched already, the Defense Ministry will send another hundred people there to support quarantine activities.

Meanwhile, President Moon Jae-in warned fake news regarding the virus. He said anyone producing or distributing made-up stories is committing a grave criminal act by obstructing public safety.
