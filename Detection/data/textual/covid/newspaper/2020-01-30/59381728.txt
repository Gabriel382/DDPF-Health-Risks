Paulinho admits he planned China exit after coronavirus outbreak 
 Former Tottenham midfielder Paulinho has revealed he considered leaving China for the sake of his family following the outbreak of the coronavirus.

The Brazilian is currently plying his trade with Guangzhou Evergrande, and lives less than 1,000 kilometres from the city of Wuhan where the virus was first discovered.

At least 170 people have been killed, while over 7,700 more were showing symptoms as of Thursday morning.

Speaking to Mundo Deportivo about the crisis, Paulinho said: 'I thought about leaving China because of the coronavirus, especially for my family, but we have been assured that we can remain calm. We are OK.

'They told us to try and leave our homes as little as possible. We will not play the league but we will participate in the Asian Champions League so we train every day.

'We are going to play in Korea, Japan and Malaysia.'

The Chinese Football Association on Thursday announced their decision to postpone the Super League season indefinitely in an attempt to control the spread.

The dramatic step follows the postponement of the World Indoor Athletics Championships, which were due to be held inÂ China in March.
