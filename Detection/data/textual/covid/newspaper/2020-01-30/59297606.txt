DOH to recommend temporary travel restrictions to Hubei, China 
 MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Health (DOH) said it will “strongly” recommend a travel restriction to Hubei province in China after the country recorded its first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus.

“By now, I will strongly recommend to the task force of emerging infectious disease, a temporary restriction of travelers from the entire Hubei province in China,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press briefing on Thursday.

Earlier, the DOH said a 38-year-old Chinese female student in Manila tested positive for the new virus, which was first discovered in Wuhan, China.

But Duque said they may impose travel restrictions in other places depending on the assessment of the World Health Organization (WHO).

“We will be waiting for assessment of WHO and recommendation whether to add the list some more places with a relatively higher burden of nCoV infection,” the Health chief said.

In China, 170 people have died and 7,000 were infected due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
