Copper near 4-month low as China virus death toll climbs 
 Jan 30 (Reuters) - London copper prices fell to near a four-month low on Thursday, set for the 11th straight session of losses, as the rising death toll from the coronavirus sparked fears of an economic slowdown in top metals consumer China.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) fell as much as 0.7% to $5,604.50 a tonne, its lowest since Oct. 4, 2019. The contract has lost about 10% since the virus started denting sentiment last week.

China's National Health Commission said the number of deaths from the coronavirus rose to 170 people as of late-Wednesday, while number of infected patients rose to 7,711.

The epidemic could slow economic growth in the world's second-largest economy to 5% or even lower, a government economist said, as authorities extended Lunar New Year holidays, companies urged staff to stay home and airlines canceled flights to China.
