Russia Closes Parts of Border with China to Combat Spread of Virus 
 Russia joined the list of countries introducing strict measures to combat the spread of the deadly coronavirus from China, in what has emerged as an early test of new Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin's government.

On Thursday, Mishustin -- in his second week on the job after being plucked from obscurity by President Vladimir Putin in a surprise government reshuffle -- unveiled a range of actions to prevent spread of the disease.

Mishustin announced he had ordered Russia's Far Eastern border with China sealed. "We have to do everything to protect our people," he said in remarks carried on state television.

According to Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova, auto and foot traffic between the countries would soon stop completely in targeted border zones. For now, Russia plans to close 16 of its 25 border points effective at midnight Thursday.

Russia's Foreign Ministry also suspended issuance of electronic visas to Chinese nationals -- Russia's largest source of tourists in recent years -- and discouraged Russian citizens from traveling to China for the time being.

Train service, however, will still be available, at least on direct nonstop rides on the famed Trans-Siberian rail journey between Moscow to Beijing until March 1.

Russia's national air carrier Aeroflot said it was continuing service for now, but offered passengers extended windows to refund tickets.

By limiting travel corridors, officials appeared to be betting that passengers could still return to their respective homes while providing health officials a way to effectively monitor the disease.
