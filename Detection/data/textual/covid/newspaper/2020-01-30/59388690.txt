Thousands being held on cruise ship in Italy as authorities test passenger for coronavirus 
 Cruise passengers are waiting to be let off a Costa Cruises ship near Rome as local authorities test a man and woman who have been quarantined on board for potential coronavirus.
 Roughly 6,000 people — 5,000 passengers and 1,000 crew — are on the Costa Smeralda in the port of Civitavecchia.
 Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Costa Cruises owner Carnival Corporation, said everyone remained on the ship as of early Thursday afternoon, local time. But a local coast guard official told The Washington Post that 1,143 passengers who had planned to disembark Thursday morning would be allowed to leave.
 According to a statement from Costa Cruises, a 54-year-old woman from Macao was put in isolation Wednesday night along with her travel companion after reporting that she felt sick. 
 “As soon as the suspected case was detected, the medical team on board immediately activated all the relevant health procedures to promptly isolate and manage the clinical condition,” the statement said. Local health authorities were on board Thursday and collected swabs from both the woman and her companion.
 Those swabs were being analyzed early Thursday, with results expected in the afternoon.
 Costa spokeswoman Rossella Carrara said the atmosphere on the ship is “all in all quite calm.”
