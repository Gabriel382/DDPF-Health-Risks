Scotland braced for first coronavirus case within days 
 The first case of the deadly coronavirus is “highly likely” to be confirmed in Scotland within days, the Scottish government said today.
Public health officials are braced for an outbreak of the illness, which has so far killed 170 people in China, to arrive north of the border. Eleven people in Scotland have been tested but all cases have been negative.
Patients exhibiting symptoms who have recently travelled from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the epidemic, have been asked to isolate themselves at home until the condition can be ruled out.
Public health legislation can be used if necessary to try to ensure that people do not mingle if there is a risk they will cause the illness to spread.
