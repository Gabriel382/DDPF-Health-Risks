First person-to-person transmission of coronavirus in US confirmed 
 The first known coronavirus case in the US involving someone who had not traveled to China has surfaced in Illinois, health officials said Thursday.

The patient, who was not identified, is the husband of the Chicago woman who became infected after making a trip to Wuhan, which is the epicenter of the outbreak, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Officials said the man, who is in his 60s, is in good condition and he is being treated in isolation at a local hospital.

“This is a very serious public health situation. Moving forward, we can expect to see more cases, and more cases means more potential for person-to-person spread,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, according to CNBC.

The report marked the sixth coronavirus case, including the person’s wife, that have been detected in the US. The other patients have been in Arizona, Southern California and Washington state.

All of the earlier cases involved travelers who returned from the Chinese central city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged last month at a market.
