Brit mum hoping to leave Wuhan with three-year-old son told to leave tot behind 
 A British mum hoping to flee Wuhan with her three-year-old son has been told to leave the lad behind.

Natalie Francis, 31, was told little Jamie would not be allowed to leave the coronavirus hit city on an evacuation flight because he holds a Chinese passport.

The English teacher has pleaded with the Foreign Office to help but they say they can’t.

Natalie said last night: “I can go with no problem, my son however can’t go.

“He suffered from pneumonia last year and the only advice they can give is for me to leave him.”

Natalie, from York, is terrified because he could fall prey to the deadly bug.

The Foreign Office said it is desperately lobbying them to allow minors to leave with their parents.

The rescue flight bringing Brits home was due to leave at 9pm UK time last night.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: “Our Embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region.”

Mr Raab said Foreign Office officials had “been working tirelessly” to get citizens out of Wuhan.

The virus has claimed more than 170 lives.

Medics in protective suits were filmed marching a woman through the London School of Economics (LSE) on Wednesday for tests.

Around 7,000 people were held on the locked-down Costa Smeralda where a Chinese couple fell ill with fever and breathing problems.

Savannah, 21, a makeup artist from Luxembourg, told the Daily Star that 24 members of her family are onboard the luxury liner being quarantined in Civitavecchia, an Italian port city northwest of Rome.

She said: “I am so worried for my family.

“My grandmother just called me right now they’re waiting for the doctors.

“I really have all my family on this boat my grandmother, my uncles, my aunts, my cousins.”
