 People have shouted racist abuse at Asians in France over the coronavirus outbreak, prompting a social media campaign. 




French Asians have launched a social media campaign to confront racist abuse they have received in response to the Chinese coronavirus outbreak, which has seen some 6,000 cases and 170 deaths.A fourth case of the deadly virus was confirmed in France on Wednesday and is said to be an elderly Chinese tourist on holiday in Paris, prompting racism and stigmatising remarks towards people of Asian ethnic origin.The French hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus [I am not a virus)]has been trending online and they use it to complain about the abuse they have received on public transport, social media and even mainstream media.A local newspaper called Le Courier Picard was criticised after it used the racist headlines, “Alerte jaune” [Yellow alert] and “Le péril jaune?” [Yellow peril?], along with an image of a Chinese woman wearing a face mask.Stephane Nivet, head of the International League against racism and anti-Semitism told BBC that no newspaper would have ever used the headline “Black alert”.Following intense backlash, the paper apologised for using some of the “worst Asian stereotypes”.One Twitter user recalled that she had been on her way home from work when she overheard two people saying, “look out a Chinese girl is coming our way.”“I’m Vietnamese,” the girl added.“First of all, all Asians are not Chinese,” another irate Twitter user said, “[secondly] all Chinese are not infected with the virus. Stop asking if we’re dangerous [when] we cough,” he said.









French nationals with an Asian background who have “never stepped foot in China” are telling people to “stop your anti-Asian racist comments and behaviour”.Lou Chengwang begged people on Twitter not to be prejudiced: "I'm Chinese, but I'm not a virus! I know everyone's scared of the virus but no prejudice, please."A woman called Minh, who is of Vietnamese origin told the French publication Le Monde that she was shouted at by a driver, who told her: “Keep your virus, dirty Chinese!
