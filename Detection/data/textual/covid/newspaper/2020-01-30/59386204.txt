  Coronavirus, the flu-like illness that has infected over 7,700  people and killed at least 170, has roiled global markets in  recent weeks, with investors concerned that the disease could  hamper global growth.

  JPMorgan slashed its quarterly and yearly growth projection for  China yesterday - analysts there say that retail, travel, and  transportation sectors will be on the frontlines of a demand-side  fallout. In markets, the SP 500 started out the week with  the   biggest drop since October, and after a temporary respite  from strong earnings reports in the US, stocks resumed   their slide Thursday.

  Nowhere is that concern stronger than in markets and shares  directly linked to China. Chinese markets are closed until  February 3 after the government announced Monday it would extent  its Lunar New Year trading freeze by three days - but offshore  markets have hammered the yuan in the interim. 

  Meanwhile, investors are also expressing their concern by  shorting Chinese exchange-traded funds and companies with  listings in US markets. Since the first confirmation of  human-to-human transmission of coronovirus on January 20, $337  million worth of new shares have been shorted, according to a  research note from S3 partners. These are the 10 companies that  have seen the biggest spikes in short interest, according to S3.
