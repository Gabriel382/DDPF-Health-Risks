Romania - Factors to watch on Jan. 30 
 BUCHAREST, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Here are news stories, press reports and events to watch which may affect Romanian financial markets on Thursday.

The finance ministry might unveil its debt issuance plans for February. In January, it sold 5.99 billion lei ($1.39 billion) worth of local currency bills and bonds, and tapped foreign markets for 3 billion euros ($3.33 billion) worth of 2032 and 2050 eurobonds.

The forint stabilised on Wednesday, within sight of its all-time lows, at the tail end of a month of declines as global worries over the spread of the coronavirus added to pressure from Hungary's loose monetary policy.
