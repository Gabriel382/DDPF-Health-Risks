Markets plunge as coronavirus fears continue to spread 
 The FTSE 100 bounce since the decisive General Election victory for the Conservatives last month was wiped out on Thursday as fears over the coronavirus spread. Shares on the blue-chip index closed the day down 101.61 points, off 1.36%, at 7381.96 – the lowest level since polling day on December 12. Traders were also not helped by the Bank of England’s decision to hold interest rates at 0.75% – sending the pound up 0.65% to 1.311 dollars. It was also up against the euro by 0.5% to 1.188 euros. Whilst the Bank of England are cautiously optimistic over the state of the UK economy currently, there are still fears over how the UK will leave the EU. At the end of this year higher trade tariffs could cause a disruption to the economyFiona Cincotta, CityIndex Typically, when the pound strengthens, the FTSE 100 falls, due to the majority of companies on the index operating in dollars. Shares also appear more “expensive” to investors who trade in dollars. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “Coronavirus fears are back at the forefront of traders’ minds, hence why stocks have fallen. “The health crisis in China is deepening as the number of confirmed cases as increased, and so has the number of fatalities. “Stocks that have exposure to China are bearing the brunt of the sell-off. Commodity, consumer as well as travel stocks are lower.” European indexes suffered equally hard, with the German Dax and French Cac both down by 1.4%. Traders also appeared to be unconcerned with the Bank of England’s other notice, which saw the central bank revise GDP down from 1.2% to 0.8% this year and 1.8% to 1.4% for 2021. Fiona Cincotta, financial analyst at CityIndex, said: “Whilst the Bank of England are cautiously optimistic over the state of the UK economy currently, there are still fears over how the UK will leave the EU. “At the end of this year higher trade tariffs could cause a disruption to the economy. Brexit uncertainty dragged on the UK economy across the past year and could potentially continue to do so this year.” In company news, BT spooked investors after revealing it will cost £500 million to adhere to the Government’s new plans to allow Huawei access to 35% of the UK’s 5G rollout.
