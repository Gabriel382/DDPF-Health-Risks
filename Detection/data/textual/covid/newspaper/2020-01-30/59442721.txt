House panel to hold hearing on response to coronavirus 
 Next Wednesday's hearing in the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation will be the first congressional hearing on the coronavirus, which has killed at least 170 people.

“While the threat of the coronavirus is relatively low in the United States at this time, we must be vigilant and prepared,” Bera said in a statement. “Congress needs to ensure the administration has the tools it needs to respond to and limit the outbreak."

As of Thursday, more than 7,700 people have become ill in mainland China, where the coronavirus originated. Another 68 cases of the coronavirus have been reported worldwide.

All of the U.S. cases to date had been from people traveling from China to the U.S. But the CDC said that a patient in Chicago became sick with the coronavirus from his spouse, who had recently traveled to China.

Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, maintained that despite the development, "our assessment remains that the immediate risk to the American public is low."

Earlier this week, the State Department evacuated nearly 200 Americans from Wuhan.
