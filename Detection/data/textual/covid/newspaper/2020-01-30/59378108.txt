 Wilbur Ross: Virus to 'help accelerate return of jobs to North America'

The US commerce secretary has said the coronavirus could help drive a return of jobs to North America as the virus, which has killed 170 people in China so far, gives companies a reason to reconsider their supply chain.

Here are Ross' remarks, made in an interview with Fox Business:

Every American's heart has to go out to the victims of the coronavirus so I don't want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease. But the fact is it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain on top of all the other things. Because you had Sars, you have the African swine virus there, now you have this, it's another risk factor that people need to take into account. I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America, some to US and probably some to Mexico as well.

Earlier this week the US scotched the idea of a visit by Ross to China.
