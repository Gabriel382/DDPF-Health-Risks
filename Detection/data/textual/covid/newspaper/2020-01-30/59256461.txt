Amid novel coronavirus threat, PLM conducts temperature check at entrance 
 MANILA, Philippines — The Pamantasang Lungsod ng Manila (PLM) has deployed personnel armed with infrared thermometers to check the temperature of all students, employees, and visitors who are entering the school’s grounds amid the threat of the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.

The temperature checks will be conducted every day until the coronavirus threat is over, according to the PLM University Health Services.

In a text message forwarded by the Manila Public Information Office, PLM President Noel Leyco said students with fever will be referred to the university clinic.

“If further evaluation is needed, the student will be referred to the Ospital ng Maynila. If the student with high fever has a history of travel to China or countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, or contract with those who traveled to these countries, he or she will be immediately referred to the DOH (Department of Health) and RITM (Research Institute for Tropical Medicine),” said Leyco.

He added thermal scanners will also be set up at the university’s entrances in addition to the use of infrared thermometers.

The DOH earlier revealed 23 patients, including 17 in Metro Manila, are now being investigated for suspected novel coronavirus.
