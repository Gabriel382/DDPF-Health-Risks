Woman in Tasmania cleared of coronavirus 
 A young woman in Tasmania has been cleared of having the deadly coronavirus.

The woman, aged in her 20s, had reported feeling unwell after a recent trip to China and was tested at the Launceston General Hospital earlier this week.

She is the second person in Tasmania to be cleared of having the virus after a Hobart man returned a negative test result at the weekend.

Some 170 people have died from the virus in mainland China.
