An Alarming Number Of People Are Searching Google For Corona Beer Because They Think It's Tied To The Coronavirus 
 The coronavirus is a very serious problem facing the world right now.

Corona beer, however, has absolutely nothing to do with it.

The coronavirus first originated in Wuhan, China.

Corona beer first originated at Grupo Modelo in Mexico.

Coronavirus symptoms include high body temperatures, dry cough, inflammation in the lungs, shortness of breath, or breathing difficulties and it’s most likely spread airborne via coughing or sneezing by an infected person.

Corona beer symptoms if too much is ingested include poorly sung karaoke and bad decisions and it is mot likely spread via bartenders, coolers, and refrigerators.

None of that, however, has stopped people from searching for the terms “beer virus” and “corona beer virus.” In fact, people performing searches for “beer virus” and “corona beer virus” so often that Google Trends has shown a massive spike for them.

Over the past 90 days, the states doing the most searching on Google for “corona beer virus” have been Hawaii, Idaho, Connecticut, Arizona, Nebraska, Massachussetts, Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, and Nevada.

Luckily, as coronavirus screening stations have now popped up at 20 different U.S. airports, not everyone is confused by the differences between the coronavirus and Corona the beer.

“We believe, by and large, that consumers understand there’s no linkage between the virus and our business,” Maggie Bowman, the senior communications director at Constellation Brands, Corona’s producer, told Business Insider.

Those last two people are not helping.
