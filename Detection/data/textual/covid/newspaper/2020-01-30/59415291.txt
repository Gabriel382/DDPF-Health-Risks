  It's time to rev up your tractors, as Farming Simulator 19 can now trundle its way onto your PC for free via the Epic Games Store. 

  
  Users have until 6th February to grab a free copy, before the freebie-baton is passed to Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride and Pandemic, all of which will be available from the 6th to the 13th. It's interesting timing for the latter, given the Coronavirus outbreak in China. 

  
  
    
  
  Farming Simulator 19 is a pretty nice-looking game, and last year even launched an esports league for those gifted in competitive hay bale stacking. Now you can get practising without needing to plough any money in.
