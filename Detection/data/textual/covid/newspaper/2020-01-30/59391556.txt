Wilbur Ross says coronavirus could bring jobs back to the U.S. from China 
 Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Thursday that the coronavirus outbreak in China will help “accelerate the return of jobs to North America.”

“Well, first of all, every American's heart has to go out to the victims of the coronavirus. So, I don't want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease. But the fact is, it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain,” Ross said during an interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo.

In response to a question about how temporarily closed businesses and suspended flights might impact the global economy, Ross said companies will need to look elsewhere after halting operations in China.
