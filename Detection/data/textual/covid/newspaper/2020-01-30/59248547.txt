A 44-year-old Chinese national has become the first person in Queensland who has contracted the virus. He travelled on a Tiger Airways flight on January the 27, with the airline confirming it is contacting other passengers who were aboard. Meanwhile, the government has defended its decision to quarantine Australians, who are stuck in the Wuhan province in China, on Christmas Island.
