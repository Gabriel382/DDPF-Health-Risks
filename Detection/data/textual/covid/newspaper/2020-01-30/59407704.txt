Coronavirus: Lawmaker charges Centre for Disease Control at alert 
 The member representing Nnewi North, Nnewi South, Ekwusigo Federal Constituency, Chris Azubogu, has called on the centre for disease control to be on the alert to ensure that cases of Coronavirus are not let into the country.

Azubogu, who spoke after returning from 10th Global Family Policy Forum held in Phoenix, AZ, USA, warned that with the ongoing spread of new dangerous disease, Coronavirus epidemic in some countries, the development should put our Nation on a state of alert.

“With the information we have about the ongoing Coronavirus epidemic, our country should be on alert. We should put up a precautionary measures that will put our Health Sector on state of alert to avoid taking us unaware,” he said.

Azubogu also called for public enlightenment on the disease by medical experts and other NGOs, so that Nigerians will know more about it and how to stay safe.

“Knowledge they say is power and I believe that with deliberate public enlightenment programmes regards Coronavirus, our people will be better informed about the disease and how to stay safe from contacting it, symptoms of the disease, where to report etc,” he said.

On whether Nigeria has the capacity to deal with epidemics like Coronavirus, Engr. Azubogu said Nigeria have achieved such milestones before, even when the world abandoned them to their fate during Ebola outbreak.

“Nigeria has capacity to contain Coronavirus epidemic with the success recorded in 2014 Ebola outbreak not minding the limited support from outside then. We have committed medical personnel with capacity to tackle medical challenges, if supported. But like I said before, we must not be taken unawares on Coronavirus.

Nigeria’s Centre for Disease Control(CDC) should put up disease control measures,” Azubogu said.
