This virus is not 'Chinese' - don't racialise it because we all have to be prepared 
 However, with Australia's seventh case of cronavirus confirmed, the panic has fuelled Sinophobia and even racism. In Melbourne, The Herald Sun's front page on Wednesday carried a headline: "CHINESE VIRUS PANDAMONIUM". Get the pun? Panda! Why racialise the cause of an epidemic? Anyone from any ethnic background can be infected by coronavirus.

Elsewhere, a video of a Chinese person drinking bat soup was used online to condemn Chinese eating habits for causing the outbreak. Later it was revealed this had been recorded not in Wuhan but on the Pacific Island of Palau.
It is true that the Chinese government’s lack of transparency and delay in updates regarding the outbreak have resulted in a general distrust from the international community; however, Sinophobia  and stereotypes of Chinese people are part of the everyday racism that ethnic Chinese communities face.
The coronavirus is allegedly linked to the wildlife trade in China, but not all Chinese people eat bats. It’s always been illegal to eat wildlife in China. My mother, who managed a Cantonese restaurant till the mid-2000s, kept telling me she would be arrested if she served pangolins to her customers.

The virus outbreak clashed with Lunar New Year, when many Chinese Australians would have returned to China. The epidemic interrupted their visits, and some may be be trapped abroad. At least 140 Australian children are reportedly trapped in Wuhan. Many people from Chinese communities feel great anxiety about their families in China. There is little discussion about what menatal health support might be extended to them.
This is a global fight against the coronavirus, not a "Chinese virus". Everyone, Chinese or not, should be prepared for the battle.
