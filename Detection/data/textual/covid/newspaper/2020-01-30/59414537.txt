 That’s how Ray Dalio, founder of hedge-fund behemoth Bridgewater Associates, says he’s approaching the stock market in light of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a note to clients this week cited by Bloomberg.

Dalio said the coronavirus has triggered a “flight-to-quality market action” that continues to pressure stocks while giving a lift to gold, bonds and the dollar DXY, -0.12%  .

At last check, the Dow DJIA, -0.15% was down double-digits, with the S&P SPX, -0.32% and Nasdaq COMP, -0.37% both firmly lower as well. Gold GC00, +0.64%  , seen as a hedge against equity pullbacks, was building on recent advances.

As manager of the world’s biggest hedge fund, Dalio’s Bridgewater has made $58.5 billion for its clients since its beginning in 1975, the most by any hedge fund, according to estimates by LCH Investments, although last year its main fund suffered its first loss since 2000.

“We want to pay attention to what’s actually happening, what people believe is happening that is reflected in pricing (relative to what’s likely), and what indicators that will indicate the reversal,” wrote Dalio, who has made more money for his clients starting Bridgewater in 1975 than any other hedge fund, according to Bloomberg.

Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Dalio told CNBC in an interview that investors should be buying this market, rather than sitting on the sidelines. “Get out of trash,” he said. “There’s still a lot of money in cash.”
