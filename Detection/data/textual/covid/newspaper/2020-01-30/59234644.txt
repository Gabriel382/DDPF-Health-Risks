Chinese Football Association Postpones Domestic Games Due to Coronavirus Outbreak - Report 
 The Chinese Football Association (CFA) said Thursday that it would postpone all domestic tournaments due to the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus.

On Wednesday, the World Athletics postponed the Indoor World Championships slated for March in Nanjing, China, until 2021, over concerns that athletes could be put at risk by competing in virus-hit China.

China's Wuhan is ground zero for the latest strain of the deadly coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, or more commonly the Wuhan coronavirus, prompting authorities around the globe to impose special screenings at airports for flu- and pneumonia-like symptoms, particularly for passengers arriving from China.

A number of major international airlines announced the suspension of flights to and from China.
