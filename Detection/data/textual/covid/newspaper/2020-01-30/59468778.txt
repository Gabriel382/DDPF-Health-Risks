Interactive map lets users track worldwide coronavirus spread in real time 
 Johns Hopkins University has created a downloadable map that tracks the novel coronavirus outbreak globally, in real time.Complete with scarlet spots delineating the places where cases have been logged, the map lets you click on one of those dots (or blobs, depending on where in the world it is) for numbers and other data. As cases are noted, the crimson creeps outward.“In response to this ongoing public health emergency, we developed an online dashboard to visualize and track the reported cases on a daily timescale,” the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering said in a blog post last week.The map can be downloaded as a Google sheet, the school says.The initial snapshot of the earliest map, dated Jan. 23, shows just a few cases emanating from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease is thought to have made the jump from animals to humans in a market. The current map shows isolated dots around the world, with a gigantic red sprawl illustrating the cases on China’s mainland.On Thursday the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency as the virus reached 7,800 confirmed cases in 18 countries, with 171 deaths, all of those in China.While most of the cases have been seen in people traveling from China’s Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, the U.S. has reported its first person-to-person infection, in Illinois.The map uses data from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, and Dingxiangyuan, a social networking site for health care professionals that disseminates real-time information on cases of all kinds of conditions and outbreaks, Johns Hopkins said.“We built this dashboard because we think it is important for the public to have an understanding of the outbreak situation as it unfolds with transparent data sources,” said civil engineering professor Lauren Gardner in a statement. “For the research community, this data will become more valuable as we continue to collect it over time.”
