Nikkei drops over 2% to 2-month low as coronavirus fears escalate 
 TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Tokyo stocks widened their losses in early afternoon trading Thursday, with the Nikkei briefly sinking more than 2 percent to its lowest level since Nov. 21, on growing concerns over the new coronavirus outbreak in China.

The spreading virus, which has infected over 7,700 people in China, prompted buying of safe-haven assets such as the yen in the foreign exchange market, weighing on exporter stocks such as electric appliance and machinery issues.
