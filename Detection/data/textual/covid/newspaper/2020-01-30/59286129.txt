First Confirmed Case of Coronavirus Reportedly Registered in Philippines 
 The Philippines' Health Ministry has confirmed the first case of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, Reuters reported on Thursday.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque said during a news conference that a 38-year-old Chinese woman, who arrived in the country from Wuhan, on 21 January, tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

The novel strain of coronavirus that was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December has since spread within China and to at least 15 other countries.

Most recently, Japan confirmed earlier in the day that three out of 206 people, who had been evacuated from China, were infected with the new coronavirus.
