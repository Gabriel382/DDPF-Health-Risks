Beijing cab driver dons full hazmat suit to keep coronavirus away 
 This yellow cabbie in Beijing is going viral.

The taxi driver took no chances with the rapidly spreading coronavirus – wearing a hooded hazmat suit, a pair of goggles and a surgical mask behind the wheel, according to the Daily Mail.

An amused passenger shot video of the germophobe, who also was equipped with hand sanitizer, as he drove her to the capital’s airport on Saturday.

“These are extraordinary times. I’m being responsible for myself and for my family,” he said.

“Quite right,” the woman responded.

“Safety first, right? It’s important to have awareness,” he added.

Footage of the decontamination attire emerged as people have been photographed wearing an array of makeshift items to ward off the new virus, including plastic jugs.

So far, at least 170 people have died and more than 7,700 have been infected by the virus.
