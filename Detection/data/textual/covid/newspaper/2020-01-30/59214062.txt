WHO Calls Meeting on Emergency Declaration on Coronavirus 
 The World Health Organization(WHO) will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to decide whether to declare a global health emergency on the new coronavirus that is rapidly spreading around the world. 


The UN agency said in a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday that it will reconvene a meeting of its International Health Regulations Emergency Committee at 1:30 p.m. Thursday.


Announcing the decision, WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that patients from Germany, Japan and Vietnam have been diagnosed with the virus without having been in China and expressed concern over human-to-human transmission outside of the country. 


The WHO committee will re-evaluate its previous decision not to declare the outbreak a global public health emergency.


Last week it stopped short of naming the outbreak a global incident, saying it remained a local crisis for the time being.
