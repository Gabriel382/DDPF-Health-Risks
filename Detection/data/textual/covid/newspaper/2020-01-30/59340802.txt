Coronavirus cure: Scientists make 'impressive' breakthroughs in decoding the coronavirus 
 The novel coronavirus sweeping through China belongs to a family of viruses responsible for past deadly outbreaks.
Between 2002 and 2003, a coronavirus strain was responsible for killing at last 774 people with severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS-CoV.
At the time, it took researchers months to properly identify and attack the virus.
This time around, Dr Pyrć argued scientists have been much quicker to analyse and breakdown the threat.
He said laboratories worldwide are already working on synthesising a cure, adding: “We are also working on it a the Małopolskie Biotechnology Centre.”
In a best-case scenario, the virus could be stopped dead in its tracks by preexisting medication and vaccines.
