Risk of coronavirus spreading in Australia is 'still there' 
 ANU’s Professor of Infectious Diseases Dr Sanjaya Senanayake says quarantining Australians trapped in Wuhan at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak is a “good idea". The coalition announced a plan on Wednesday to place 600 Australian evacuees from Wuhan on Christmas Island for a two week incubation period. The “potential for this virus to spread is still there” said Mr Senanayake because “we know this virus can be transmitted when people don’t have symptoms”. Australians need not panic at this stage he said because “we have a robust public health infrastructure and well-trained border protection services”. Image: Getty
