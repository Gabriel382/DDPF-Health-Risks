Strayed regularly tweets about politics. She also discusses the Trump administration, the #MeToo movement and other political issues in interviews.

She told Vox that after learning Trump was elected in 2016, “I knew the American electorate was divided politically, but I also knew something else: For all our flaws, we were not a people who’d choose a man to be our president who was so plainly, so essentially, so completely, a disrespectful brute.”
