WHO declares global health emergency on coronavirus 
 BEIJING/NEW YORK -- The World Health Organization has declared the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus a global health emergency.
At a WHO emergency committee meeting Thursday to discuss the novel coronavirus, the panel members reversed a decision from a week ago, and urged the U.N. agency to declare the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus a "public health emergency of international concern."
Last week, the panel had said it was "not the time" for an emergency declaration due to a lack of evidence of the outbreak spreading outside China.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters after the meeting that this was an "unprecedented outbreak."
He also commended the Chinese government's response to contain the outbreak and said this declaration was "not a vote of no confidence on China."
China's Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the capital, said Thursday evening that another 317 cases have been confirmed in the province, pushing the number of confirmed patients worldwide to over 8,100 -- surpassing the number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, during the 2002-03 period.
