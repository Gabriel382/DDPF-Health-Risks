Coronavirus outbreak: Trudeau calls on Canadians to combat 'unreasonable fears' over illness 
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday that Ottawa was doing "everything we can" to support Canadians impacted in China by the coronavirus outbreak, and stressed that he wanted everyone to "lean on each other" to combat "unreasonable fears" being spread on the internet about the virus. 



He also said they could not provide a date yet on when a chartered plane would bring back repatriated Canadians from China, but said they are working with international partners and looking at what the World Health Organization's recommendations are to prepare for when it does arrive.
