Thousands unable to disembark Italy cruise ship over Coronavirus fears 
 More than 6,000 people have been stopped from disembarking a cruise ship in Italy over fears two Chinese passengers could be carrying the Coronavirus. The Costa Smeralda was locked down after a 54-year-old woman from Macau presented with fever and breathing difficulties. She and her husband - who doesn't have any symptoms - have been placed in isolation. Preliminary tests suggest they're not carrying the virus. Image: AP
