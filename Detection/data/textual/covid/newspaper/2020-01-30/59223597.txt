 Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma has become the latest technology industry figure offering to help fight the coronavirus outbreak.
China's richest man will donate 100 million yuan ($21.4 million) through his charitable foundation, joining Bill and Melinda Gates in pledging assistance. That's on top of an offer by his internet juggernaut Alibaba Group to establish a 1 billion yuan ($213.5 million) fund and share its artificial intelligence expertise with researchers.

"We know that the battle between humanity and disease is a long journey," the foundation said in a post on its Twitter-like Weibo account. "This money will help various medical research efforts and help disease prevention."
China's tech industry has responded rapidly to an outbreak that's infected thousands and killed more than 150 around the globe.
