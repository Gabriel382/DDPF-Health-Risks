Car-onavirus: Chinese cabbie wears HAZMAT SUIT to avoid coronavirus 
 This Chinese cabbie is taking no risks over the coronavirus - opting to wear a full hazmat suit to drive his passengers in Beijing.

Hilarious footage shows the driver wearing the yellow decontamination suit with the hood up and a pair of goggles and a surgical mask added for good measure.

The video was taken by an amused female passenger who was heading to the capital city's airport on Saturday.

The highly contagious disease has now claimed 170 lives in mainland China and there are nearly 8,000 confirmed cases worldwide.

But while almost everyone wears a face mask to protect themselves, full hazmat suits are unusual.

After telling the cabbie to get to the airport 'as soon as possible', the passenger asks her driver: 'Do you get many clients while dressed like this?'

The cabbie, who has a bottle of hand sanitiser, explains: 'These are extraordinary times. I'm being responsible for myself, and for my family.'

After the passenger says, 'Quite right,' the cabbie continues: 'Safety first right? It's important to have awareness.'

The World Health Organization has so far stopped short of calling the epidemic a global health crisis, but the UN body is to meet today (30th January) and discuss an escalation of the virus's status.
