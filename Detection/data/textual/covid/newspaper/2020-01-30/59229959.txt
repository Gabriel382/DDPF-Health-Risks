Coronavirus: Britons on Wuhan flights to be quarantined - BBC News 
 Hundreds of British citizens, waiting to be flown home from the region of China worst-affected by the new Coronavirus, will be put in quarantine for two weeks on their return to the UK. 



Passengers will be asked to sign a contract agreeing to commit to what's called 'supported isolation' although the timing of the flight and the destination is not yet known. British Airways has suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China because of the outbreak.



The virus which was first detected in the city of Wuhan has caused more than 130 deaths spreading from China and to at least 15 other countries. 



The World Health Organisation warned on Wednesday that the whole world needs to take action to stop the spread of the new virus.
