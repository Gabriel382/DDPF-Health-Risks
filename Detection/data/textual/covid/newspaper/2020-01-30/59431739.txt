Locked-Down Italian Cruise Ship Passengers Await News of Coronavirus Scare 
 About 6,000 people were stuck aboard the Italian cruise ship Costa Smeralda at Civitavecchia, northwest of Rome, on January 30 after a Chinese passenger showed possible symptoms of the coronavirus. A couple were investigated for coronavirus symptoms, and a woman – reported as a 54-year-old from Macau – was found to have a fever and respiratory problems. She was placed in isolation overnight, Costa Crociere, the cruise operator, said. The couple had arrived in Italy on January 25. Ernesto Tedesco, mayor of Civitavecchia, tweeted that he was monitoring the situation and in contact with maritime health authorities. This footage shows passengers – some wearing masks – walking within the ship’s interior, inquiring about their luggage, and sitting on lounge chairs on the deck as an announcement about the health investigation is broadcast.
