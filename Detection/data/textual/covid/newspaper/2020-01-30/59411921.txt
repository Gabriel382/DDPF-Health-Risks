Cruise Ship on Lockdown Off Italian Coast Amid Coronavirus Scare 
 About 6,000 people were stuck on board the Italian cruse ship Costa Smeralda at Civitavecchia, northwest of Rome, on January 30 after a Chinese passenger showed possible symptoms of the coronavirus. A couple were investigated for coronavirus symptoms, and a woman – reported as a 54-year-old from Macau – was found to have fever and respiratory problems. She was placed in isolation overnight, Costa Crociere, the cruise operator, said. The couple had arrived in Italy on January 25. Ernesto Tedesco, mayor of Civitavecchia, tweeted that he was monitoring the situation and in contact with maritime health authorities. This footage shows the Costa Smeralda at Civitavecchia’s port.
