WHO declares coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) named the coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, a public health emergency of international concern. Outside of China, there are now 98 confirmed cases in 18 countries, including eight person-to-person transmissions in Germany, Japan, Vietnam, and the U.S., according to comments made by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, on Thursday afternoon. At least 170 people have died in China, and nearly 8,000 have been sickened. "Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill-prepared to deal with it," Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
