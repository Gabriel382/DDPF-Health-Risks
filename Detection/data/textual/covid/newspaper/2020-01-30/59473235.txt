Italy confirms first two cases of coronavirus as passengers allowed off cruise 
 Italy has confirmed its first cases of the deadly coronavirus, shortly after the World Health organisation declared the outbreak a global emergency.

Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, revealed that two Chinese tourists have tested positive for the virus and all air traffic has been blocked between Italy and China.

It comes after more than 6,000 passengers and 1,000 crew members were stuck on an Italian cruise ship north of Rome on Thursday, after a Chinese woman, 54, fell ill.

Officials from the Costa Smeralda ship said the woman and her partner, who had no symptoms, were put into isolation Wednesday.

Passengers were allowed to disembark on Thursday night after tests came back negative, said Italian coast guard Captain Stefano Varone.

Italy is the fourth European country, after France, Finland and Germany, to have confirmed cases.
