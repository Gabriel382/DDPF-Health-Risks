Coronavirus may help boost US jobs: Wilbur Ross 
 WASHINGTON: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday that the deadly coronavirus may hurt the Chinese economy and push jobs back to the US. “I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. Some to US. Probably some to Mexico as well,” Ross said during an interview when asked about the economic effects of the virus in China. “Well, first of all, every American’s heart has to go out to the victims of the coronavirus. I don't want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease. But the fact is, it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain, on top of all the other things.”President Donald Trump on Wednesday named a dozen people to serve on a newly formed coronavirus task force. , Ross is not a member of the task force.
