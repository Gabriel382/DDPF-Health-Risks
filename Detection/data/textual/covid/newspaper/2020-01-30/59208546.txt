Beijing yet to approve repatriation of Australians trapped in Wuhan 
 Australian residents trapped in Wuhan, where the coronavirus originated, are weighing up an evacuation offer from the federal government. The Coalition announced it would evacuate Australians trapped in the region and fly them to Christmas Island to be quarantined for two weeks, but the repatriation has yet to be approved by Beijing. Meanwhile, an alert has been issued for anyone who dined at a restaurant in Glen Waverley, Melbourne on Sunday after it was revealed a man ate at the venue before he was diagnosed with coronavirus.
