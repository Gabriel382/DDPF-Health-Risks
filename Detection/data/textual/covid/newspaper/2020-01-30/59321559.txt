Second case of coronavirus confirmed in Queensland 
 A second case of novel coronavirus has been confirmed in Queensland, health authorities say.

Queensland's chief health officer Jeannette Young said in a statement a 42-year-old woman who is a Chinese national from Wuhan has been confirmed with the virus.

Dr Young said the woman was a member of the tour group travelling with the 44-year-old man who was Queensland's first confirmed case yesterday.

The woman is in a stable condition and currently isolated in the Gold Coast University Hospital.

"Contact tracing is underway, which will allow us to provide information to guests of the hotel this group was staying in, and to other passengers on Tigerair flight #TT566 from Melbourne to the Gold Coast on January 27, 2020," Dr Young said in the statement.

"Any passengers who were on this flight should call 13HEALTH for advice."

Dr Young said the seven other people from the same tour group remained in isolation in Gold Coast University Hospital.
