Coronavirus Lockdown: Authorities Are Nailing In Wooden Planks, Locking Houses With Iron Chains 
 In an attempt to contain the spread of coronavirus, the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, has been under lockdown since January 23. 
The most recent report states that 7,700 people are infected and 170 people have died from the fast-spreading virus.

In a bid to stop people from moving out of their homes, authorities in China have allegedly been ordered to lock houses with iron chains and nail wooden planks on the entrance. 
   The viral pictures have sparked a debate on the inhumane method of keeping people in isolation. 
   After the government made an announcement on the lockdown, people across Chinese cities went on a desperate run to stock, food and supplies. However, the supplies are now running dry and people have no way to move out. 
 Drone footage posted by the South China Morning Post shows just how deserted the city of Wuhan, with a  population of about 11 million, looks after the lockdown and it's distressing.

The spread of the virus has not just taken a physical toll but also a mental one on residents who have been forcefully cut off from friends and family. 
   People are feeling an immense sense of loneliness and fear amid the lockdown. The lockdown comes on the eve of Lunar New Year, one of the most important dates in the Chinese calendar, where millions of people travel to see loved ones.
