Wilbur Ross says coronavirus potential boon to U.S. economy 
 Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the coronavirus would spur businesses to shift their supply chains out of Asia.“I don’t want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,” Ross said. “(But) I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America.”Ross claimed that corporations would weigh the risk of future health crises when deciding where to produce goods.“It does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain,” Ross said. “On top of all the other things, you had SARS, you had the African swine virus there, now you have this. It’s another risk factor that people need to take into account."A cruise ship with more than 100 Americans on board was confined in an Italian port after two passengers from Hong Kong displayed flu-like symptoms.Although the virus has largely remained confined to China, it is showing signs of spreading rapidly to Hong Kong, elsewhere in Asia and even the U.S.So far there have been five confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. along with more than 100 suspected cases. Public health experts say that number could rise sharply and it could affect the global economy in a way that would sharply affect the U.S.President Trump did not immediately comment on Ross’s remarks. He took a much more sympathetic tone in a tweet that offered China and the world American help containing the virus.Just received a briefing on the Coronavirus in China from all of our GREAT agencies, who are also working closely with China.

Actually, he’s probably lost a lot of steps." But that was two years ago and he hasn’t gone anywhere."
