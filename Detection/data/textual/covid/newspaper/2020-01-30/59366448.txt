        British nationals trapped in Wuhan will return home on Friday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said.
Chinese authorities have confirmed the evacuation flight will leave at 05:00 local time (21:00 GMT Thursday). It is expected to land at RAF Brize Norton.
The flight, carrying 200 Britons, was due to leave the centre of the coronavirus outbreak earlier but was delayed because of a lack of clearance.
The virus has caused 170 deaths and spread to 15 other countries.
