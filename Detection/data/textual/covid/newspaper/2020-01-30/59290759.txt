Woman left with brain injury after argument in mum’s group chat turns violent 
 Two Sydney women have been hospitalised after an argument about coronavirus in a mum’s online group chat turned physical.

The pair, aged in their 30s, were discussing the deadly illness on social media when they “agreed to resolve their differences in person, one bringing along another member for support”, according to the Northern Beaches Police Area Command.

“The argument quickly escalated from verbal to physical; pushing, slapping, hair pulling and finally both on the ground, briefly unconscious, all despite the efforts of bystanders trying to intervene,” officers said.

“Both ended up in hospital, one needing a scan for a possible brain injury and the other x-rays for a shoulder injury as well as treatment for cuts, bruising and swelling to her arms, upper body and neck.”

Police have taken out a Personal Violence Order against one of the women.

Charges are yet to be laid as investigations continue.
