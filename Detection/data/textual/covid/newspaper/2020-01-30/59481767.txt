Market fears escalate as Chinese companies halt production to stop spread of coronavirus 
 Founder of the Switzer Report, Peter Switzer says there are "question marks for the stock market"with Chinese companies "basically stopping production" because they don't want the coronavirus to spread. "We don't know how long it's going to go for and the longer it goes on, the higher the uncertainty and the more likely for sell-off to occur," he said.
