British Airways halts China flights for a month 
 LONDON: British Airways took the most dramatic step yet among global carriers in response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak, saying it will halt flights to China for a month. The UK operator will cease services linking London with Beijing and Shanghai up to and including Feb. 29, it said in a statement on Thursday, adding that the move follows Foreign Office advice against “all but essential travel”. While a host of international airlines have been suspending or paring back operations to China, BA’s action goes further and indicates the heightening levels of concern as the virus death toll rises above 170 and confirmed cases in the Asian nation soar past 7,700.
