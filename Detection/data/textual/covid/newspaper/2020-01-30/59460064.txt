Terrified dog yelps as it is barbecued ALIVE in vile Chinese street market in shocking clip released by campaigners 
 SICK videos of dogs being burned alive in China's cruel and dirty meat markets have been released by animal rights activists.

The footage, which The Sun Online has decided is too graphic to share, shows a person pouring boiling water over a skinned dog.

While another video shows a dog still barking and opening its bloody jaw as it is barbecued alive.

Other footage shows the animals stuffed in tiny cages near next to animals who are skinned alive and slaughtered on site with no regard for sanitation.

The videos come from activists who are planning to march up to London's Chinese embassy and demand an end to the trade as coronavirus continues to devastate the country.

A message from the campaign group, No to Dog Meat, says: "Your food markets have no control over sanitation and nor do the majority of your restaurants.

"It is time to end the live slaughter and abject cruelty to dogs and cats in your markets (including Wuhan). It is time to end the illegal trade of dogs and cats for food and fur."

The animal’s meat is still in high demand in some regions.

Roughly 10 million dogs and four million cats are slaughtered every year in the People’s Republic, having been stolen from back yards, crammed into cages on the back of lorries and driven for days with no food or water.

According to Humane Society International, only 20 per cent of China’s population regularly eats dog and only 65 per cent have tried it.

The group says the vast majority of demand comes from the country’s southern, central and northeast region.
