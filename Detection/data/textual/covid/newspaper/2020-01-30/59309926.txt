Chinese cities are 'dead' from a lack of business over coronavirus fears 
 Many businesses in China have been impacted by the "devastating effects" of the deadly coronavirus, as people are extensively "self-quarantining," according to China-based correspondent for The Wall Street Journal James T. Areddy. Over 7,700 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in China, with over 170 deaths. "In many cities in China it is just very dead out there, people are just not moving around," he told Sky News host Chris Smith. Mr Areddy said it is "his understanding" the coronoavirus is "not as deadly as the SARS virus," however it does spread "spread very, very rapidly" among infected patients. Image: Associated Press
