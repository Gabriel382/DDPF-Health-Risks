WHO declares 'public health emergency of international concern' for Coronavirus 
 The World Health Organisation has declared the Novel Coronavirus outbreak is a global "public health emergency of international concern" in a press conference in Geneva. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said "we don't know what sort of damage this virus could do if it were to spread in a country with a weaker health system." "We must act now to help countries to prepare for that possibility. For that reason, I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern," he said. Dr Ghebreyesus affirmed the declaration was "not a vote of 'no-confidence' in China", stating WHO had "confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak."
