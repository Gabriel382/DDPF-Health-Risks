 The coronavirus is making global share markets increasingly unwell.

That as banks start to crunch the numbers on the virus's economic impact.

Firms exposed to China were among those to take a hit Thursday.

Earning reports didn't do much to help sentiment.

Telecom firm BT also sharply down after it warned of costs from limiting Huawei's role in building 5G networks. 

There were some bright spots though. 

 Unilever  (LON:), HM and Volvo among firms to gain on stronger-than-expected earnings. 

Attention also on the Bank of England.
