Coronavirus: More cases than SARS epidemic 
 Infections from China's coronavirus have spread to more than 8100 people globally, surpassing the SARS epidemic's total.

The vast majority of patients are in China where the virus originated in an illegal wildlife market in Wuhan and has gone on to claim 170 lives, latest official data showed.

But more than 100 cases have emerged in other countries, from Japan to the US, spurring anti-China sentiment and a wave of mask-buying.

South Korean firm Kukje Pharma is considering doubling or tripling shifts to cope with a rush of orders for "tens of millions" of masks.
