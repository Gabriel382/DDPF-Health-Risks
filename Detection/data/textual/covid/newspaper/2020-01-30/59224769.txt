Auckland suburb cancels Chinese New Year festival amid coronavirus concerns 
 On-going concerns around the deadly coronavirus have caused the Northcote Chinese and Korean New Year Festival to be cancelled.

There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in New Zealand, but organisers said they needed to be cautious.

Northcote Town Centre Manager Gary Holmes said the event was being cancelled reluctantly but that it was the right thing to do in this particular situation.

"Northcote has a very high population of travellers to and from China, especially during Chinese New Year and the situation is still unknown.

"Our local Chinese community, including those performing and attending, have told us they would prefer that the event did not proceed this year, which we understand and respect," Holmes said.

The organisers said the festival, which attracts thousands of people, would return in 2021.

The new coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, was first identified in Wuhan, China.

At least 106 people have died in the outbreak, and more than 4400 people have been infected in more than a dozen countries.
