Third coronavirus case confirmed in Vic 
 A Melbourne restaurant is closed until Feb 9 after a man with coronavirus ate there on Jan 26

Victoria's health department is gathering information on possible coronavirus public exposure sites after a third case surfaced.

A Chinese woman in her 40s has been confirmed as the third Victorian case of the deadly virus on Thursday evening.

The woman has been isolated in the Royal Melbourne Hospital, with eight other people awaiting results of their coronavirus tests in Victoria.

The visitor from Hubei province is in stable condition and two close contacts are being monitored for symptoms.

Two new cases of coronavirus infection confirmed on Thursday evening - this new case in Victoria and another in Queensland - brought the total number of cases in Australia to nine.

The health department is yet to confirm the woman's location and movements before she was referred to hospital.

It has been revealed that a man in his 60s, who was confirmed as having the virus on Wednesday, had dinner with his family on Australia Day at The House Of Delight restaurant in Glen Waverley.

Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Brett Sutton has urged anyone at the restaurant between 5.30pm and 7pm on January 26 to be watch for symptoms.

Although Dr Sutton said the restaurant was allowed to open, a sign outside the establishment says it will remain closed until February 9, "in order to minimise the risk of the Novel Coronavirus".

The man became infected while travelling in China's Hubei province. His five relatives were put in isolation with him, and four of them were yet to receive results of their tests.

As of Thursday evening, tests have so far cleared up to 71 people of the virus in Victoria.
