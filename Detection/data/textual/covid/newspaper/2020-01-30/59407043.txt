Coke earnings show beverage maker's bet on healthier options is paying off 
 Coca-Cola's bet on sugar free and sparkling drinks to meet its customers shifting tastes is paying off.

The beverage giant, which has introduced drinks like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, and smaller-sized sodas, said its revenues soared 16% in the final three months of 2019 and 9% for the full year.

"We made good progress in 2019 by delivering on our financial commitments and growing in a more sustainable way," James Quincey, the company's CEO said in a statement.

Americans, along with global consumers, are increasingly seeking out healthier options, bypassing traditional sodas for drinks that are sugar free or lower in calories.

Sales of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar grew by double digits last year, and Coca Cola is participating with its peers in an initiative to help customers cut their calorie intake. That includes promoting Coca-Cola products that are no and low calorie as well as miniature sized sodas that come in 7.5 oz cans.
