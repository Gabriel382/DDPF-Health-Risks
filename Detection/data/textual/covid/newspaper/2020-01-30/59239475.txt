The virus is spreading rapidly from one person to another and the way one can truly be safe is by keeping his mouth and nose covered, which resulted in people going ahead and buying masks in bulk, however, some drugstore owners thought this would be a great way to earn more money. 
Drugstore owners in the capital of China, Beijing started hiking the prices of a regular mask six times more than the price of the mask online -- but with such a dire situation, people had no choice but to pay the hiked prices. 
However, Chinese authorities, when they found out about such practices, they’ve gone ahead and fined one bad-acting store dubbed Jimin Kangtai Pharmacy for 3 million yuan which is approximately Rs 3 crores.
The store raised prices for a box of 3M brand masks that would normally cost just 143 yuan to a whopping 850 yuan. 
 Authorities have sped up the investigation and are on the lookout for other stores that are continuing similar practices. They’ve caught 31 stores so far that were either hiking prices or hoarding stocks.

They even shut down a store in the city of Shanghai, who was selling masks of substandard quality -- asking him to refund money sold to people and destroying the existing stock.

Wuhan Coronavirus is showing no signs of stopping, affecting over 6000 people and claiming over 132 lives -- not just in China but across the planet.
Wuhan Coronavirus is deadly as it causes not just pneumonia-like symptoms but also severe breathing issues -- and there isn’t any medication to cure this just yet, the symptoms go away on its own. Doctors prescribe flu and pain medication to ease the symptoms.
