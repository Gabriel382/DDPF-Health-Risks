Wilbur Ross says coronavirus ‘will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America’ 
 U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross argued Thursday that there is a silver lining for the American economy in the coronavirus that’s hitting China and spreading to other countries.

The Trump administration official offered the following take during an interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo:

His comments came after Bartiromo expressed concerns that the Chinese economy, which helps drive global growth, might “come to a halt.”

“Well, first of all, every American’s heart has to go out to the victims of the coronavirus, so I don’t want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,” Ross said in response to her point.

“But the fact is it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain on top of all the other things, because you had SARS, you had the African swine virus there, now you have this,” he added.

Ross said the virus is “another risk factor that people need to take into account,” and he then made that prediction about North American jobs.

The death toll rose to 170 in the new virus outbreak in China on Thursday, and world health officials expressed “great concern” that the disease is starting to spread between people outside of that country.
