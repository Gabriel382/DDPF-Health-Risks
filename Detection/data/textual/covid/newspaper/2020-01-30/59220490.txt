Coronavirus death toll rises to 170 as Australians remain trapped in Wuhan 
 The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has climbed to 170 as Australian residents trapped in Wuhan are weighing up an evacuation offer from the federal government. The Coalition announced it would evacuate Australians trapped in the region and fly them to Christmas Island to be quarantined for two weeks, but the repatriation has yet to be approved by Beijing. Health Minister Greg Hunt also confirmed two Australians in China contracted the virus, but have since been released from hospital. There are now seven confirmed cases in Australia, with one patient in isolation in Queensland, two in Victoria and four in New South Wales. Meanwhile, an alert has been issued for anyone who dined at a restaurant in Glen Waverley, Melbourne on Sunday after it was revealed a man ate at the venue before he was diagnosed with coronavirus.
