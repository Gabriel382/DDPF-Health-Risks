 CEBU CITY, Philipines —The first confirmed patient of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 n-CoV) in the country is not among the two possible cases now being monitored in Central Visayas, the regional head of the Department of Health (DOH-7) said.

Bernadas said that the patient did not seek medical help while in Cebu or Dumaguete and is now in isolation in a hospital in Manila.

The woman from Wuhan City in China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, arrived in the Philippines on a tourist visa on January 21, DOH officials led by Secretary Francisco Duque III revealed in a press conference earlier this afternoon, Thursday, January 30.

The DOH is now closely coordinating with DOH-7 in tracing the places where she went and the persons she came in contact with so that they could also be monitored.
