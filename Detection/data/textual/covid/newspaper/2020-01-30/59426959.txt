CDC records coronavirus case that spread within US 
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday confirmed the firstÂ case of the coronavirus spreading from one person to another within the United States.

All of the U.S. cases recorded so far had been from travelers returning to the U.S. from China, where the virus originated.

But the CDC on Thursday said a patient in Chicago contracted the coronavirus from her spouse, who had recently traveled to China.

"We understand this may be concerning but based on what we know now our assessment remains that the immediate risk to the American public is low," said CDC Director Robert Redfield.
