Mother’s group chat about coronavirus ends in serious brawl 
 Two women are in hospital after they took an argument in a Facebook mothers’ group offline, and got into a serious brawl.
Northern Beaches police in Sydney shared the story on its Facebook page, saying the women, in their 30s, had a disagreement about coronavirus online.
“It began with an argument between two women on a mothers’ group chat site about the current coronavirus and its effects,” they said.
“From there, the women, both aged in their 30s, agreed to resolve their differences in person, one bringing along another member for support.
“The argument quickly escalated from verbal to physical; pushing, slapping, hair pulling and finally both on the ground, briefly unconscious, all despite the efforts of bystanders trying to intervene.”
One woman needed a scan for a possible brain injury and the other X-rays for a shoulder injury as well as treatment for cuts, bruising and swelling to her arms, upper body and neck.
Police said they had taken out a Personal Violence Order for one against the other as investigations continue.
People on Facebook were quick to comment, with several saying the women weren’t setting a good example for their kids.
