South Florida School Group May Have Been Exposed To Coronavirus 
 PALM BEACH GARDENS (CBSMiami/AP) — During a four-day conference at Yale University last weekend, 30 students and three teachers from a Palm Beach Gardens school may have been exposed to coronavirus.

The group from The Benjamin School expected test results by mid-week but were informed Wednesday that a backlog at the only U.S. lab testing for the virus means they possibly won’t hear until the end of the week, the Palm Beach Post reported, citing a letter sent to parents from the school’s interim director Thomas J. Reid.

For now, they are confined to their homes. 

The news comes as worldwide concern is growing over the viral disease. China has reported 170 deaths from the virus and at least 7,700 infections. More people have now been infected by this coronavirus in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. 

Reid told parents that the Centers for Disease Control suggested they could consider allowing the group back on campus. But school doctors advised it would be best for them to remain at home “until we have conclusive news,” Reid wrote.

Health officials across the world are trying to take adequate precautions without triggering mass panic for an illness that has been confirmed in only five people in the U.S. — all of whom are believed to have contracted the virus when traveling abroad.
