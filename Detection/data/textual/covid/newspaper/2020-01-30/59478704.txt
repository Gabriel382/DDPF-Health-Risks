The Health Ministry is holding an extraordinary meeting of the National Committee of Health Security as an answer to the declaration of international emergency for the novel coronavirus issued by the World Health Organization (WHO).

On its Twitter account, the Ministry headed by Jorge Alcocer Varela informed that after the alert issued by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the general director of the WHO, authorities called for an emergency meeting to define the measures Mexico will implement.

Ghebreyesus announced the decision after a meeting of its Emergency Committee, an independent panel of experts, amid mounting evidence of the virus spread to some 18 countries.

Tedros told a news conference in Geneva that recent weeks have witnessed an unprecedented outbreak which has been met by an unprecedented response.

The declaration of a global emergency triggers recommendations to all countries aimed at preventing or reducing the cross-border spread of disease while avoiding unnecessary interference with trade and travel.

 It covers temporary recommendations for national health authorities worldwide, which include stepping up their monitoring, preparedness, and containment measures.

Among those present at the meeting are the deputy ministers of Health Prevention and Promotion Hugo López and Gatell Ramírez; Asa Ebba Christina Laurell and Pedro Flores Jiménez from Health Integration and Development, the head of Finance and Administration Unit Pedro Florez Jiménez, the director of the National Center for Prevention Programs and Disease Control Ruy López Ridaura, the director of Epidemiology José Luis Alomía Zegarra, as well as the director of the National Institute for Social Security (IMSS) Zoe Robledo Aburto and the director of the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers (ISSSTE).

Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Marcelo Ebrard is attending a similar meeting at Community of Latin American and Caribbean States to address the same topic.
