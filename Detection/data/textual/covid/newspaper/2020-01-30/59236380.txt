Samal Island off limits to Chinese, other Asian tourists amid virus scare 
 MANILA, Philippines — The Island Garden City of Samal in Davao del Norte has temporarily suspended entry of Chinese and Asian tourists in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus (nCoV).

In a Facebook post, the island’s public information office said that while tourism is important to its local economy, their people’s health remains to be a top priority.

“As a proactive measure to protect our people from exposure to the much-dreaded coronavirus, the Local Government Unit of the Island Garden City of Samal is temporarily suspending entry of group tour travels of Mainland Chinese tourists and other Asian nationals to our city,” the island’s public information office said Wednesday.

“While we are promoting our city for tourism but the safety of our people is foremost,” it added.

The local government also asked stakeholders to support the initiative aimed  at ensuring the safety of the people.

“We are requesting our partners especially the tour operators and agencies and all other stakeholders to support the local government in this endeavor to ensure the safety of everyone,” it said.

No case of nCov infection has so far been confirmed in the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) said.

The government, however, has imposed stricter measures to combat the virus, such as suspending the issuance of  visas upon arrival to Chinese visitors.

Deaths caused by the virus has reached 170 with over 7,000 people infected, as of Thursday.
