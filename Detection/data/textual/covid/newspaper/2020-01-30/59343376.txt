China delays start of football season as Wuhan coronavirus cases top 7,000 
 The Super League, the country's premier division, was due to commence February 22 and run to October 31. A new start date has not yet been announced.

This year's Chinese FA Super Cup game, a match between China FA Cup winner Shanghai Shenhua and Chinese Super League champion Guangzhou Evergrande, had been scheduled for February 15.

In a statement on its website, the Chinese Football Association said postponing the "2020 season national football competitions at all levels" was taken to help with the "prevention and control of the pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection, and to protect the health of the majority of fans, media, players, coaches, game officials, clubs and district staff".

"The Chinese Football Association will continue to maintain close communication with national authorities, to determine the timing of each event in this season based on the actual development of the epidemic situation at various locales," it added.
