First UK coronavirus case 'very likely' to strike in the coming days 
 The UK is “very likely” to have its first coronavirus case in the coming days, according to Scotland’s chief medical officer.

So far there have been 161 tests for the virus in the UK but all have been negative.

Many of the people fearing they had the virus were quarantined at home although some with more serious conditions were taken to hospital.

Scotland’s chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood said on Thursday: “It is highly likely we’ll have a positive case of coronavirus in Scotland in the coming days.

“The public can be assured that Scotland has well-established plans and is well prepared for these types of outbreak.

“We have a proven track record of dealing with challenging health issues and have established public health and infectious disease experts working round the clock.

“We have also activated our emergency resilience operation.”

The government has said that the risk to the public remains low and a plan is in place for dealing with a confirmed case.

Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director and director of health protection for Public Health England said the first UK case is likely to come from someone already in the country.

Anyone who believes they have symptoms for the virus is urged to contact NHS 24.

The government is currently negotiating with Chinese authorities on plans to fly out around 200 British citizens who have been in Wuhan and the surrounding province.

Health officials have warned travellers returning to the UK from Wuhan to avoid contact with others for two weeks even if they have no symptoms.
