The coronavirus outbreak in China has killed 132 people so far and infected more than 7,000 people, and it has spread through every province, The New York Times reported. Several cases of the virus have been diagnosed in the US.President Trump said in a Monday tweet that it's in "very close communication" with the Chinese government, and noted China is "working very hard" to contain the virus.The outbreak has also roiled markets and led to forecasts of reduced Chinese economic growth in first few months of 2020. One forecast from JPMorgan cited the closure of factories in some major cities until February 9."Undoubtedly the impact will be visible," JPMorgan analyst Haibin Zhu said, adding, "if the virus outbreak keeps on escalating and factory shutdowns are extended and also expanded to other regions, then the shock will also evolve into a supply shock and the impact on China and the rest of the world will be even bigger."
