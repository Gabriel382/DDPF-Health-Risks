TWO ARE UNDER SURVEILLANCE
Agnes Buzyn also said the first flight, which will later repatriate French nationals from the Chinese town of Wuhan - the epicenter of the virus - would depart France for China later on Wednesday, with a second flight to follow on Thursday or Friday.

France confirmed its first three cases of the Wuhan coronavirus on Friday, and a fourth case on Tuesday. “We now have five cases, out of which two are under surveillance,” Buzyn said at a press conference.
