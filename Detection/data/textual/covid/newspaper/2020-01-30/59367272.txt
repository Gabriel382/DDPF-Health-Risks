Visits to Macau fall 80%, impacting Las Vegas Sands 
 Shares of Las Vegas Sands Corp. LVS, +0.45% were down 1.5% in premarket trading on Thursday after the casino operator said visits to Macau were down 80% as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Visits to Singapore are also down, as well, but to a lesser degree, Las Vegas Sands president and chief operating officer Robert Goldstein said, according to a FactSet transcript of Wednesday's earnings call. Macau's operations make up 64% of the company's total revenues. "Every segment is in decline for every property," he said. However, Goldstein said that once the virus is contained and activity resumes, he expects to see high demand at its casinos. "When it does resolve, Macau is going be very, very, very busy because - whether you know it or not, these folks like to gamble," he said during the call. "They will come back in force." Las Vegas Sands' stock is up 3% over the last three months, while the S&p 500 SPX, -0.09% has gained 7% during that period.
