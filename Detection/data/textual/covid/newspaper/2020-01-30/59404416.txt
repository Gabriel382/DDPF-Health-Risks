					There are 160 Canadians who want the federal government to get them out of China amid growing fears over the spreading coronavirus.
Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne​ said Canada has secured a plane to bring them home but couldn’t answer questions on what the exact process or protocol will be getting them out or when they arrive back in the country.
	
		
		
	Canada has also upgraded its travel advisory for China, urging Canadians to avoid all non-essential travel there.
The minister could not answer if any of those 160 returning Canadians are infected with the coronavirus or what will happen to them once they land. Will there be a quarantine process?
The affected areas around Wuhan are locked down, with China not allowing movement in or out of these cities.

Government officials are using diplomatic channels to get the Canadians out, which follows flight cancellations by Air Canada and other major airlines involving China due to the virus.Maybe during those talks, Canada could suggest swinging by to grab the two Michaels — Spavor and Kovrig — or at least ask how they’re doing.
