Person-to-person transmission of coronavirus reported in US, CDC says 
 Much of China is on lockdown as the infection grows to 8,000 people; Benjamin Hall reports.




The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported the first case of person-to-person transmission of coronavirus in the U.S. In a telebriefing on Thursday, Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC director, said the health agency had expected to identify "some" person-to-person spread in the U.S., but that risk to the American public "remains low."
The case involves a Chicago resident, who is the spouse of the first confirmed travel-related case in Illinois. Both patients are in stable condition.
The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 7,700 people and has been linked to at least 170 deaths.
