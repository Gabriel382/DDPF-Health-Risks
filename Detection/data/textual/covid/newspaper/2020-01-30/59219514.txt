Qld virus victim spent time in Melbourne 
 A Chinese man diagnosed in Queensland with coronavirus also spent time in Melbourne, and four fellow travellers are now ill and being tested for the disease.

Efforts are also underway to track down people who shared the man's Tiger Airlines flight from Melbourne to the Gold Coast on January 27, flight number TT566.

The man came from Wuhan - the Chinese city at the epicentre of the virus outbreak - and flew to Melbourne via Singapore, landing there on January 22.

He spent time in Melbourne before flying north five days later. He went to his accommodation but became increasingly unwell and ended up calling an ambulance.

Queensland's Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young says eight fellow travellers in a tour group have been tested, and four of them are sick.

"There are eight other people who were in that tour group and they are all currently in isolation in the Gold Coast University Hospital. Four of them are unwell and being tested today," she told reporters in Brisbane.

"We'll get those results later today. Four of them are well at this time, but will continue to monitor them."

The man who has the virus remains in isolation at the same hospital, in a stable condition.

Health Minister Steven Miles said authorities were trying to track down everyone who was on the man's flight from Melbourne to the Gold Coast.

He said anyone on the flight should contact Queensland Health immediately for advice, but said there was no need for panic.
