Coronavirus outbreak: Cruise ship with 6,000 passengers stuck at Italian port after virus scare 
 An Italian cruise ship with some 6,000 people stuck on board remained docked at the Italian port of Civitavecchia on Thursday as two Chinese passengers were tested for the new strain of coronavirus. 



The couple arrived in Italy on Jan. 25 and boarded the ship, the Costa Smeralda, in the port of Savona that same day. They subsequently came down with a fever and were suffering from breathing difficulties.



No one was allowed off the ship while medical checks are carried out to see if the pair have the potentially deadly coronavirus, the company spokesman said.
