 Washington: US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday that the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, and has killed at least 170 people could be positive news for the US economy.

Ross made the remark during an appearance on Fox Business network's Mornings with Maria after saying the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which President Donald Trump signed in a White House ceremony on Wednesday, made a recession in 2020 "almost physically impossible."
Host Maria Bartiromo asked if the spread of coronavirus could offset the gains he predicted the deal would bring.
"First of all, every American's heart has to go out the victims of the coronavirus. So, I don't want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease," Ross said.
