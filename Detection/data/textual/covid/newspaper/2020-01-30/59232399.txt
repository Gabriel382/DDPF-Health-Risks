79 Chinese arrive in Davao City as new coronavirus cases climb globally 
 MANILA - Some 79 Chinese tourists arrived in Davao City on Wednesday noon as health officers continued strict screening of passengers for the 2019 new coronavirus (nCoV).

All passengers from Jinjiang were cleared of fever, said Dr. Wilson Lim, head of the airport's Bureau of Quarantine.

â€œWala namang me lagnat. Napansin ko rin na lahat naka mask na pati mga flight attendant," he said.

Most Dabawenyos have canceled their trips to China, according to travel agent Ireine Campos. Davao City has direct flights to Jinjiang in Fujian province and Hong Kong.

The Philippines has yet to confirm a case of the new strain of virus but is monitoring one individual in Davao for possible infection, along with 22 others in Metro Manila (17), Central Visayas (2), Western Visayas (1), Mimaropa (1), and Eastern Visayas (1).
