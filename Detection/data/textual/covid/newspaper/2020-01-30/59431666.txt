Investing.com – The SP remained near session lows Thursday as investor sentiment was soured on rising fears over the potential impact of the coronavirus on global growth and weakness in tech stocks, led by a slump in Facebook (NASDAQ:).

The  fell 0.70%, while the  lost 0.75% and the  slipped 0.53%.

More than 8,200 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed worldwide and the death toll in China rose to 170 individuals, raising fears that a further spread of the virus will weigh on economic growth in China, which makes up about 10% of global growth.

Stocks sensitive to growth in China and tourism continue to give up gains. 

Starbucks (NASDAQ:) fell 1.6%, Booking (NASDAQ:) slipped 1% and Carnival (NYSE:) fell 4%.

Corporate earnings provided a sliver of respite for stocks, with Coca-Cola (NYSE:), Tesla (NASDAQ:), Microsoft (NASDAQ:) impressing, but Facebook (NASDAQ:) coming under pressure amid worries about slowing growth.

Coca-Cola (NYSE:) reported quarterly revenue that topped revenue estimates as the launch of new products underpinned growth, sending its shares up 2%.

Tesla (NASDAQ:), meanwhile, surged about 10% after the electric automaker topped earnings estimates and pledged to deliver over 500,000 cars for the year, well above consensus of about 475,000.

In tech, Microsoft (NASDAQ:) climbed about 2% as strong growth in its cloud business boosted sales to record levels, above Wall Street estimates.

But gains in tech were kept in check by a plunge in Facebook (NASDAQ:) as the social media giant's beat on the bottom and top lines were overshadowed by a 51% surge in costs and worries about slowing growth as the company ramps up efforts to bolster security on its platforms.
