WHO declares the coronavirus outbreak is an 'international emergency' 
 The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared an international emergency over the deadly coronavirus that originated in China.

The declaration is a rarely used designation that could lead to improved international co-ordination in tackling the disease.

"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems.... This is not a vote of no confidence in China," World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing in Geneva.

However, WHO says there is no reason to restrict international travel over China virus.

Several major airlines have already suspended flights to China.
