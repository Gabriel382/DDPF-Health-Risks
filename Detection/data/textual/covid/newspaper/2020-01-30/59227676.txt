Coronavirus 'won't have same impact on market as SARS' 
 InvestSmart Chief Market Strategist Evan Lucas says over the last few days “the market has looked as though it is going to be contained,” and is “not going to be on the same level as Sars”. Mr Lucas told Sky News “GDP has been pretty well-maintained”. “It is not great, but it is not anywhere near the levels we’ve seen elsewhere in the world,” he said. “I look at it economically rather than necessarily from the markets.” Image: AP
