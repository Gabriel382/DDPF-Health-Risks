Coronavirus fears as 'Hazmat' medics seal off York hotel room and treat guest 
 CORONAVIRUS fears have been sparked in York after medics in Hazmat suits were seen treating an unwell guest yesterday.

Terrified witnesses saw the paramedics in protective suits going into a Staycity aparthotel in the city centre.

A man was taken to hospital last night at around 8pm after becoming unwell with possible coronavirus symptoms.

His hotel room has been reportedly cordoned off, and the building set to be deep cleaned.

The Yorkshire Post reported the man is a Chinese national, but this was unable to be confirmed.

He is said to have arrived with two companions, but it is not known where he had initially travelled from.

There are no confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK, but 130 have been tested since returning from the centre of the outbreak, Wuhan.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars).

Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while others - like the one that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) - are far more severe.
