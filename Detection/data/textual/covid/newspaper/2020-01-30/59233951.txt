Coronavirus: Inside the locked down Chinese city with virus deja vu 
 These days, getting fresh food in Foshan for Li Xiyan means waking early and having sharp elbows to fend off other people. Shops are struggling to replenish stocks after authorities blocked numerous transport links across China in efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

“The supermarkets don’t have much,” said Ms Li, 55, who lines up before the doors open at 8am. “It’s OK, we just eat less."

But simple meals at home are a far cry from how she normally spends this time of year, celebrating the Lunar New Year holiday at banquets with family and friends.

In Foshan, in south-eastern Guangdong province, local officials have cancelled public events and shuttered tourist attractions – including a theme park honouring homegrown kung-fu icon Bruce Lee. Few cars travel the roads, shops are shuttered and empty public buses criss-cross the city, which is known for its textile manufacturing.

Many have obeyed the government’s recommendation to stay at home to try and reduce exposure to the new virus, which has infected nearly 7,711 and killed more than 170.

Guangdong has confirmed more than 200 cases, making it the second hardest-hit after Hubei province, which is home to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. Wuhan is on lockdown as experts race to work out the cause of the virus, and how to stop it, and British nationals have been evacuated.
