First case of human-to-human Wuhan coronavirus transmission in U.S. confirmed 
 The first instance of person-to-person transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus in the United States – the sixth case overall – was confirmed by the CDC today.

The Illinois patient is a man in his sixties who is married to a 60-year-old woman who contracted the virus after traveling to Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak.

Illinois health officials said the man has underlying medical conditions but is in stable condition. Jennifer Layden, the state's chief medical officer, said he was exposed to the virus when his wife was symptomatic. So far, U.S. officials have not seen evidence of asymptomatic transmission of the virus.
