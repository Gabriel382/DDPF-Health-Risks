Metro drugstores run out of masks, disinfectants as first nCoV case confirmed 
 MANILA, Philippines – People all over Metro Manila have flocked to drug stores to buy face masks, sanitizers and other disinfectants following confirmation that a Chinese tourist had tested positive for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Photos taken from a drug store in Maysilo Circle, Mandaluyong on Thursday evening — hours after the Department of Health (DOH) announcement — showed a notice telling customers face masks have been sold out.

“Very, very, very sorry po talaga, ubos na po face mask (we’re very sorry, the face masks have run out),” the sign said.

“Lahat ng klase ng alcohol, and lysol (disinfectant) na lang po, thanks (only alcohols and disinfectants are available, thanks),” it added.

Another drug store in Cubao, Quezon City, also said that they have run out of face masks.

The shortage of face masks was expected by many after news broke out that a 38-year-old Chinese national was infected with the 2019-nCoV — especially since masks were in demand among Metro Manila and Southern Luzon residents as a precautionary measure for the Taal Volcano eruption last January 12.

This recent strain of the coronavirus, compared to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, originated in Wuhan, China.  Since then, more than 7,000 persons have been infected, with 170 confirmed dead.

The virus has forced Wuhan’s local government to shut down outbound train trips and flight, to avoid the spread of the virus.  However, reports say that every region in mainland China has a confirmed 2019-nCoV case.
