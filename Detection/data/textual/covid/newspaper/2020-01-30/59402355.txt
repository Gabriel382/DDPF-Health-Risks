27 possible cases of coronavirus currently under investigation in Ontario | News 
 The Ontario government confirms that 27 coronavirus cases are currently under investigation in the province.

The number of confirmed cases remain at two in Ontario.

The first Ontario patient remains in hospital, and is in stable condition. The second is at home, and health officials say she is “feeling well.”

In an update on Thursday, Ontario health officials said there have been 67 cases tested for coronavirus, and 38 were negative.

Ontario’s chief medical officer of health Dr. David Williams said that China has shown that the coronavirus is not as contagious as measles.

Dr. Williams said that young people are getting over the novel virus quickly, and older patients are more impacted.

Of the negative cases, Dr. Williams said some had other seasonal viruses.
