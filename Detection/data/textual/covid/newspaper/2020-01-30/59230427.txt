Coronavirus Live Updates: New Zealand Charters Plane to Evacuate Citizens from Wuhan

The 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or the Wuhan coronavirus, has spread from China to over a dozen countries, including the United States, France, and Japan.

Winston Peters, New Zealand’s foreign minister, announced that the government has agreed with national carrier Air New Zealand to arrange a chartered flight to Wuhan to evacuate citizens, according to local media.

Peters urged New Zealand citizens in Hubei to register on Safetravel if they would like to board the plane.

Effective Jan. 30, Air Canada is suspending all direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai until Feb. 29, the airlines said in a statement.

The decision came after the Canadian government released advice for Canadians to avoid non-essential travel to mainland China.

The airline said that impacted customers will be notified and offered other options, “including travel on other carriers where available, or a full refund.”

“Air Canada regrets this situation and apologizes for the serious disruption to our customers’ travel plans,” it said, adding that adjustments to the cancellations may be announced as the situation continues to evolve.

The airline joins American Airlines, British Airways, and others to halt flights into China, with some offering only limited services to Hong Kong.
