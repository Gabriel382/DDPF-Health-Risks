World Health Organization Classifies Wuhan Coronavirus as International Health Emergency 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the Wuhan Coronavirus as an international health emergency. Over 8,000 people have caught the virus in China, with 170 deaths resulting from it so far. The virus poses a risk of becoming a worldwide pandemic. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the spouse of one of the first U.S. cases has caught the virus, despite having never been to Wuhan. So far people in 19 countries have been affected, but no one has died outside of China. CDC director Robert Redfield said, "We understand that this may be concerning, but based on what we know now, we still believe the immediate risk to the American public is low."
