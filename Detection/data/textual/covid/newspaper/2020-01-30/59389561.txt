Cruise Passengers Are Held at Italian Port Over Coronavirus Fears 
 ROME — Thousands of passengers aboard an Italian cruise ship were being blocked from disembarking in a port town north of Rome on Thursday over fears that a passenger might have contracted the coronavirus that has sickened more than 7,700 people in mainland China and killed at least 170.
A woman from Hong Kong aboard the ship, the Costa Smeralda, came down with a fever and was experiencing respiratory problems, according to the Italian news agency ANSA, which reported that about 6,000 people were on board. A statement from the cruise company confirmed that a “sanitary protocol” had been put in place for one passenger.
The precaution comes amid international fears that the outbreak of the coronavirus — first detected in a seafood and poultry market in Wuhan Province, China, last month — will become a widespread epidemic. Although most of the thousands who have contracted it are in mainland China, least 68 cases have been reported elsewhere around the world.


The ship docked in the port town, Civitavecchia, on Thursday morning after arriving from the Spanish port of Palma de Majorca. It had been operating a seven-day cruise in the Western Mediterranean, and included stops in Italy, France and Spain.
