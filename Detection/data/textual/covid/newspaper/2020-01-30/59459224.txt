Three Japanese evacuees positive for virus 
 Three Japanese evacuated from Wuhan on a government-chartered flight have been confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, including two who had not shown any symptoms.
The two were the first cases in Japan of people without symptoms being confirmed to have been infected with the virus, the health ministry says.
Japan on Tuesday designated illness caused by the new virus as "designated infectious disease", which would allow compulsory hospitalisation and the use of public funds to treat such patients. But the designation - which takes effect on February 7 after ordinances are issued - does not apply to those without symptoms.
Inaugurating the government's special task force for the coronavirus, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government would take all steps possible to prevent the spread of the virus. Among the measures, the government would confirm contact information of all entrants into Japan who have a record of staying in Wuhan and conduct health checks.
Japan now has confirmed 11 cases of the virus, including a tour bus driver who was infected after coming into contact with Chinese visitors.
The three new cases were among 206 Japanese who were evacuated to Tokyo on Wednesday from Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic.
Of those evacuees, 12 were hospitalised because they had symptoms such as fever and coughing, and two refused to be taken to the hospital for checks but were escorted home. The remaining 201 all tested negative, a ministry official told a briefing.
