Man died in Chinatown after people 'refused to give CPR over coronavirus fears' 
 A Chinese man who suffered a suspected fatal heart attack in Sydney was reportedly left to die on the pavement because onlookers were too scared to give CPR in case he had coronavirus.

The 60-year-old man collapsed outside a restaurant in the Chinatown district on Tuesday night, New South Wales Police said.

Medics battled to revive him at the Masuya Suisan in Haymarket but he died at the scene at around 8.30pm, Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported.

According to news.com.au, NSW Police would not comment on reports in the Telegraph that bystanders refused to attempt resuscitation over fears about the virus.

More than 6,000 people have been infected by the deadly virus and 170 killed since it spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where 11 million remain on lockdown.

Australia has confirmed seven cases relating to people who had recently returned there from Wuhan – four in New South Wales, two in Victoria and one on Queensland.

All are stable and being treated in hospital.

Hundreds more Australian citizens evacuated from Hubei province face the prospect of being sent to a remote island used to banish asylum seekers and convicts.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said notorious Christmas Island struck the right balance between supporting Australians stranded in China and protecting the wider population from the potentially deadly disease.

He told reporters in Canberra: ‘The reality is people need to be accommodated somewhere for up to 14 days.

‘I can’t clear out a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane. I don’t have a facility otherwise that we can quickly accommodate for what might be many hundreds of people and Christmas Island is purpose-built for exactly this scenario.’

The Australian Medical Association said people would be better quarantined on the Australian mainland.
