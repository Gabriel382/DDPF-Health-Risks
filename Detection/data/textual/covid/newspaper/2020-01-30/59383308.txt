Coronavirus, the flu-like illness that has infected over 7,700 people and killed at least 170, has roiled global markets in recent weeks, with investors concerned that the disease could hamper global growth.JPMorgan slashed its quarterly and yearly growth projection for China yesterday — analysts there say that retail, travel, and transportation sectors will be on the frontlines of a demand-side fallout. In markets, the S 500 started out the week with the biggest drop since October, and after a temporary respite from strong earnings reports in the US, stocks resumed their slide Thursday. Nowhere is that concern stronger than in markets and shares directly linked to China. Chinese markets are closed until February 3 after the government announced Monday it would extent its Lunar New Year trading freeze by three days — but offshore markets have hammered the yuan in the interim.  Meanwhile, investors are also expressing their concern by shorting Chinese exchange-traded funds and companies with listings in US markets. Since the first confirmation of human-to-human transmission of coronovirus on January 20, $337 million worth of new shares have been shorted, according to a research note from S3 partners. These are the 10 companies that have seen the biggest spikes in short interest, according to S3.
