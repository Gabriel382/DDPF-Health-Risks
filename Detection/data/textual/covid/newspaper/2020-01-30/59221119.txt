Chinese ambassador advises against evacuation of Indians 
 NEW DELHI: China appears to be dragging its feet on allowing India to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. The Chinese ambassador in New Delhi has advised India against evacuation, citing a World Health Organization official. Permission has not been given to India even 48 hours after it was sought. “The WHO does not recommend evacuation of nationals, and called on the international community to remain calm and not overreact,” ambassador Sun Weidong tweeted, quoting WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as saying in Beijing. Evacuation of citizens will further dent China’s image and economy, people aware of the matter hinted. “Chinese Government requested for permission to operate two flights to bring back our nationals from Hubei Province of China. @EOIBeijing in touch with Chinese authorities on the ground to work out necessary logistics. We will share regular updates,” the ministry of external affairs spokesperson tweeted. “@EoIBeijing is working hard to ensure smooth evacuation of our citizens from Hubei Province. We are already in touch with many sections of Indian Community in Hubei, including our students. We urge all Indian citizens from Hubei who have not yet contacted the Embassy to do so urgently on our hotlines,” the Indian embassy tweeted. While India prepares for evacuation of its nationals from Wuhan, Pakistan appears to be toeing allweather friend Beijing’s line that the situation is under control and has maintained silence over the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 100 people.
