The mayor of a New Jersey town admitted he recently got drunk at a party at a township employee’s house, took off his pants and passed out in her bed, according to a report.
Mayor John Roth said he apologized to the unidentified employee, NorthJersey.com reported.
The story came to light after an anonymous letter signed by the “concerned employees of the township of Mahwah” detailed the incident. The letter was circulated last week, the report said.

The effort to recall Laforet was launched in January 2018  by a group of citizens who were upset about his 2015 accusations against former Department of Public Works Director Ed Sinclair for having pornography on his work computer, based on an anonymous letter Laforet received.
