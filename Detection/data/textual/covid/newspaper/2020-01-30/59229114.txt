Baguio free of new coronavirus ahead of Panagbenga Festival: mayor 
 MANILA - Baguio City has not recorded any cases of novel coronavirus, its mayor said Thursday ahead of the expected surge of tourists for the Panagbenga Festival next month.

"Sigurado po dadami po ang tao dito, closely natin ina-activate ang ating monitoring teams para dito sa coronavirus," Mayor Benjamin Magalong told radio DZMM as he urged the public not to spread disinformation.

The festival's Grand Street Dance Parade will be held on Feb. 29, while the Philippine Military Academy will also hold its homecoming on Feb. 15, the mayor said.

The city government will coordinate with the Department of Health on placing thermal scanners in "strategic locations," according to Magalong.

The DOH on Wednesday said it was monitoring 23 suspected cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus in Metro Manila (17), Central Visayas (2), Western Visayas (1), Mimaropa (1), Eastern Visayas (1), and Davao (1).
