Coronavirus: Senate sends critical message to Nigerian government 
 Nigeria Senate on Thursday asked the Federal government not to lower its guard against the dreaded Coronavirus, saying that prevention was better than cure.

Moving the motion under order 42 and 52 of Senate rules, Senator Chukwuka Utazi representing Enugu North Senatorial District and Chairman of Senate Committee on Health, feared that the dreaded disease ravaging China could have its presence in Nigeria in the face of inaction.

“Mr. President, distinguished colleagues, you are aware of the contamination of Coronavirus, the dreaded disease that is characterised with running nose, sore throat, feeling unwell and feverish.

“The virus has killed about 170 Chinese within a short period.

Utazi said that the Chinese authority has put millions of her people to watch in order to curtail further contamination.

He further stressed that the Federal government through the National Centre for deasease control should monitor the likely breakout of the virus.

Contributing, Senator James Manager representing Delta South Senatorial district disclosed that the paranoia of Coronavirus stopped him from travelling to China.

He said Chinese which is the most populous country in the world are all over the country, but have mostly travelled to their country to celebrate their lunar year celebration.

The lawmaker urged the government to quarantine them when returning to the Country.

Adopting the motion, Senate President, Dr Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan urged the “Federal government to release more funds to the National Centre for Disease Control to acquire recent and most sophisticated equipment as part of measures against Coronavirus in Nigeria.

He added that Nigerians travelling to Asia especially China should heed to the Federal government’s travel ban.
