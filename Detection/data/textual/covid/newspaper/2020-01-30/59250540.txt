LAHORE (Dunya News) - The number of individuals suspected to have contracted the deadly coronavirus has risen in Lahore, with two new patients admitted to the Services Hospital in Lahore.

According to sources, 23 years old woman and her three years old son showed symptoms of coronavirus. Suspected patient took an exam in a private university where examiner was a Chinese.

Blood samples have been sent to a laboratory for confirmation if the patients contract coronavirus or not before their treatment could be started.

Earlier, Punjab Health Secretary Captain (r) Muhammad Usman on Wednesday has told that no case of coronavirus has been reported in the province.

In a statement, the health secretary said that decision regarding the disease of three patients admitted in Lahore’s Services Hospital and two in Multan’s Nishtar Hospital is yet to be taken.

On the other hand, the death toll from coronavirus in China rose sharply to 132 with nearly 1,500 new cases, heaping pressure on Beijing to control the disease.

Fears of the spreading virus have already pushed airlines around the world to reduce flights to China and global companies to restrict employee travel to the country, while sectors from mining to luxury goods have been shaken by concerns for global growth in the event of a worst-case pandemic.

New cases were reported around the world including Germany, where four people from the same company were infected after one of them contracted it from a colleague while visiting their workplace in China.

Health authorities believe the virus originated from an animal and have pointed to a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was traded illegally.
