CSIRO to test possible coronavirus vaccine 
 The CSIRO will study potential coronavirus vaccines at its high-containment facility in Victoria

Coronavirus research outside of China will be carried by Australia's federal government agency CSIRO.

Two days after researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne became the first scientists to recreate the virus outside China, CSIRO aims to paint a clearer picture.

The lab-grown virus - which was developed from the first patient diagnosed in Australia - will help with accurately diagnosing the disease around the world.

The CSIRO says it is collaborating both with the Peter Doherty Institute and the University of Queensland, where trials have begun to develop a vaccine.

The research will aim to understand if vaccines developed for the virus work and are safe, with studies to be conducted at CSIRO's high-containment Australian Animal Health Laboratory facility in Geelong.

The coronavirus death toll has risen to 170, with the World Health Organisation set to meet to decide on whether to declare a global emergency.

The total number of people infected in Australia rose to nine after two new cases were confirmed on Thursday evening.
