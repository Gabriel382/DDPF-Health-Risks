Bong Go supports possible China-PH travel ban, other measures to prevent nCoV spread 
 The statement of Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go:

For the record, I never said that I am against the imposition of a travel ban if it is necessary. I support the possible temporary China-PH travel ban and other necessary measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

In fact, I was even one of the first to suggest it two days ago when I said that I will recommend to President Rodrigo Duterte the ban on flights and ship travels between the country and China if it is necessary to prevent the entry of the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV to Philippine shores.

For those who were not able to read my whole statement released a while ago, allow me to reiterate important points I raised with regard to measures being done to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in our country:

Part of what I said in my statement also emphasizes that in these times of crisis affecting the whole world, it is not proper to condemn a whole country and its people. Instead, this is the time to show compassion and be vigilant with our actions. That is why I said this:

I am appealing to all Filipinos for your cooperation. Let us not panic, but at the same time, let us take the threat seriously and cooperate with authorities in order to ensure the safety of everyone.
