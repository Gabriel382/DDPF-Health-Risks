“America demanded change and change is what we got,” the narrator says in the commercial, which was released on Thursday. “Under President Trump, America is stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before.”

The ad is intercut with news reports about wage growth and historic low unemployment numbers for Latinos and African Americans.

It closes with Trump at a campaign rally saying: “Ladies and gentlemen, the best is yet to come.”

The 30-second ad is one of two that the Trump campaign will run during the nation’s most-watched sporting event. The campaign said the second will not be released until it airs live for the first time during Super Bowl LIV.

The campaign has estimated the cost for the two ads to be about $10 million.
