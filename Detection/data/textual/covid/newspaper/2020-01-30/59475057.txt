Worried about coronavirus after holiday in China, chip shop owners temporarily close up 
 A Wellington chippy has closed its doors temporary, with its owners isolating themselves till Monday after a recent holiday to China.

Regulars at Thorndon's Starfish Fish and Chips To Go were greeted with a sign telling them the shop would remain closed after a holiday break to "keep everyone safe from exposing to this potential risk" from the novel coronavirus.

Shu Lu, who owns the shop with her husband Alex Feng, told Stuff she and she and her husband had returned home from five week holiday in China last Friday.

Lu said she had not visited Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, but had passed through Guangzhou airport on the way home, a city which now has 354 confirmed cases.

She said Ministry of Health guidance was unclear for people returning from China who had not visited Wuhan should and so she and her husband had decided to take a precautionary approach. Neither she or her husband felt unwell.

"There is no clear guidance for people coming back from China, so we are just doing what we think is the right thing to do," she said.

"We don't want to be those people."

Lu said she had left her four-year-old son in China with grandparents amid concerns about having him travel on an international flight, but was now worried for him as the outbreak worsened.

"I can't do anything about it now. I can just pray for him and hope the family is safe."

In the meantime, she and her husband were hanging out at home until they re-opened the shop on Monday.

"We have a dog, so we chase the dog around for exercise."
