U.S. oil futures mark lowest finish since August 
 Oil futures fell Thursday, with U.S. prices dropping to their lowest settlement since early August, as concerns over the economic impact of the coronavirus raised the potential for a slowdown in global energy demand. March West Texas Intermediate oil CLH20, -1.91% fell $1.19, or 2.2%, to settle at $52.14 barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the lowest front-month contract finish since Aug. 7, according to FactSet data.
