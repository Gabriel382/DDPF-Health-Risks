BMW extends holidays for Chinese production workers - spokesman 
 MUNICH, Jan 30 (Reuters) - German luxury carmaker BMW will extend its factory holidays at its plants in Shenyang, China, by one week until Feb. 9 over travel restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus, a company spokesman said on Thursday. 
The measure applies to workers in production, the spokesman added. Office workers will resume working on Feb. 3, but from home. (Reporting by Joern Poltz; writing by Thomas Seythal; editing by Tom Sims)
