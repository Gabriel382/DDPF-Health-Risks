Wuhan Residents Wait in Line to Buy Face Masks at Pharmacy 
 Residents in Wuhan, the city in which the coronavirus originated, were seen waiting in line to get face masks at a pharmacy in the city on January 29. Video shows a line of people waiting at the door of the pharmacy, and then piles of empty boxes inside. The video was filmed on the same day that broadcaster CGTN released a report investigating the availability of essentials like disinfectant and face masks in Wuhan. A reporter visited five drug stores, of which only two had face masks in stock. In Hong Kong, people waited in line around a block on January 30, after a local pharmacy announced it was supplying a limited number of masks. Credit: Darkainst via Storyful
