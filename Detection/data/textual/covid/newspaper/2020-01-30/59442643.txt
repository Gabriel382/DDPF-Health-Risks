Founder of world's biggest hedge fund playing it safe as virus spreads 
 The coronavirus outbreak has triggered what Dalio describes as "flight-to-quality market action," with equities selling off globally, while bonds, gold and the dollar versus the yuan have rallied. Being able to understand how investors are reacting will be key, he says.
"We want to pay attention to what's actually happening, what people believe is happening that is reflected in pricing (relative to what's likely), and what indicators that will indicate the reversal," Dalio wrote.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. strategists say the turmoil in global equities brought about by the coronavirus outbreak could end up a buying opportunity. The sell-off in stocks could continue before the situation improves, but in the past such major outbreaks only led to a drop in share values of about 4.7 per cent on average, they noted. The SP 500 Index has fallen 2 per cent since hitting a closing record on January 17.
In a note documenting major pandemics dating back a century, Dalio said that no one has any clue on where and to what extent the coronavirus will spread and how will it impact economies and markets. He went on to discuss the economic impact of the Spanish flu that rocked the world in the early 20th century and killed more people than World War I.
