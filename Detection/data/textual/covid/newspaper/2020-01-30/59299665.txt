Coronavirus Patient Zero: Why Wuhan market may not be the epicentre of deadly China virus 
 “Five days after illness onset, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward.”
According to Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University, the data suggests the first novel coronavirus infection occurred in November or earlier.
The viral expert told the journal Science the incubation time between infection and first symptoms emerging, does not match the December 1 date.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the novel coronavirus has an incubation period between two and 10 days.
Dr Lucey said: “The virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace.”
