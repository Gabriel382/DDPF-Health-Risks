Planes grounded due to coronavirus scupper potential Arnautovic West Ham return 
 Marko Arnautovic wanted a sensational return to West Ham ahead of the transfer deadline – before all flights out of China were grounded.

Mirror Sport understands that just six months after his move to Shanghai SIPG, Arnautovic has been angling for a move back to the Premier League, with West Ham among several clubs sounded out.

The Hammers, searching for a new frontman to support Sebastian Haller, were open to the idea but had to abandon it after flights from China were grounded because of the deadly coronavirus.

During his two years at West Ham, Arnautovic netted 22 times in 60 appearances but he forced a move to China in July 2019 after having one blocked seven months earlier.

In Shanghai, he has scored nine times in 15 appearances.

West Ham are instead locked in a £16million transfer battle with Crystal Palace for Hull forward Jarrod Bowen.

The 23-year-old fits the profile of player David Moyes wants and is the third top scorer in the Championship with 16 goals.

West Ham want a striker, a midfielder and a right-back before Friday's 11pm deadline.

The club are desperate for reinforcements as they bid to avoid relegation from the Premier League.

Skipper Mark Noble called out his teammates after their defeat to Championship West Brom in the FA Cup, and defender Aaron Creswell says it has focused minds at the London Stadium.

“There are certain words that get said in that dressing room all the time — you won’t hear them,” he said. “But I can assure you now that everyone is fully focused and understands the job ahead that we’ve got.

“We have to stick together not just as players and the coaching staff, everyone involved at West Ham. We have to do our best now until the end of the season.

“Of course [players calling each other out] it is a positive. It’s not just the thing with Nobes, there is plenty more that gets said.”
