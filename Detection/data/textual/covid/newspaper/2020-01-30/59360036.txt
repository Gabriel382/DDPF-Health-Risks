Brit hotel on coronavirus lockdown after guest rushed to hospital 
 A Chinese national was rushed to hospital by paramedics in hazmat suits after he fell ill at the Stay City hotel in York.

The unidentified man was rushed to the central York hotel by medics on Wednesday night sparking coronavirus fears.

Paramedics wearing Hazmat suits entered the hotel and rushed to the mans aid as China reported the deadly virus’ death toll had reached 170 people worldwide.

The tourist's room is being subjected to an "environmental clean and disinfection" and his belongings had been cordoned off.

In a statement, a spokesman for the hotel told Hull Live: "Staycity Group have confirmed that a Chinese national staying at the group’s property in York was taken ill yesterday and is understood to be undergoing tests at a local hospital.

"Paramedics accompanied the man, along with his two travelling companions, out of the property at around 11.30pm last night.

"StayCity is unable to confirm which hospital the three people were taken to or what the outcome of the tests are at this point.

"Until more is known the apartment containing the group’s belongings will be cordoned off, along with surrounding rooms, after which the area will undergo a thorough environmental clean and disinfection, as is company policy."

Ambulance crews reportedly accompanied the man and his two travelling partners from the building at around 7.50PM.

York Teaching Hospital NHS Trust would not confirm whether they were treating the man and Public Health England do not comment on individual cases.

It is not yet known whether the individual has a suspected case of the coronavirus but the country is alert as the virus continues to sweep across the world.

There have been no confirmed cases in the UK so far but 6,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide - most of them travellers who had returned from Wuhan.
