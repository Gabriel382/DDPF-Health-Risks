'Highly-mutable' coronavirus 'still something we’re learning about' 
 Professor Bill Rawlinson, senior medical virologist says human-to-human transmission from coronavirus “was expected from the start, given what we knew about SARS and MERS”. Professor Rawlinson told Sky News the virus was “highly-mutable” and was probably instigated “through bats and another animals to emerge and infect humans”. “It doesn’t necessarily weaken or strengthen, what it does is it allows that virus to move through people and to transmit,” he said “The recovery process is still something we’re learning about. “Ultimately we want to control person-to-person spread and hopefully that won’t get worse, and then eventually we hope it dies out.” Image: Getty
