Dan Walker: BBC host blasted on Twitter for announcing incorrect Coronavirus death toll 
 Even thugh previously getting the death toll correct, the BBC presenter mistakenly announced that it had jumped to 300 while recapping the program's highlights, leaving viewers who had just tuned in rather alarmed.
The jump panicked fans who took to Twitter to question the presenter's “incorrect” announcement, and demanded he verify his sources if it was true.
“China announce 130 #coronoavirus deaths but @mrdanwalker announces on @BBCBreakfast that the Chinese government are wrong and the figure is 300,” the user retorted.
“Can you provide sources Dan?”
Quick to respond, Dan wanted to set the record straight after his slip up.
“I have corrected it Nich,” he said.
“Official number is 132. Thanks for watching.”
