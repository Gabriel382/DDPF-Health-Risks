Novel Ways In Which Chinese People Are Protecting Themselves Against Novel Coronavirus 
 As the number of those infected by coronavirus rises--7,700 confirmed cases worldwide--medical supplies, especially surgical masks, are in low supply.
 While China scrambles to cope with its worst public health crisis since the SARS outbreak in 2003, people are trying out everything to shield themselves from the virus. 
 From using plastic bottles to covering themselves with plastic sheets, people in China are desperate. While the situation is grim, people on social media are trying to make light of the situation by posting some hilarious pictures of ‘Chinese Coronavirus Jugaad’.

Local hospitals across China have also said there is an urgent shortage of medical masks, goggles, gloves, and protective suits.
 According to an Aljazeera report, given the lack of supplies, some medical equipment manufacturing factories have had no option but to call in workers to meet the growing demand. 
 A Guardian report states that five of the 12 main mask-producing companies based in Guangdong province have resumed production after pausing for the lunar new year holiday.
 While tackling a shortage of medical supplies, authorities in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, are also rushing to build two emergency hospitals, one of which is planned to contain 1,000 beds and be up and running by Feb. 3. 
 To help China tackle the shortage of medical supplies, the world's largest aerospace company Boeing announced a donation 250,000 medical masks. 
 Boeing said its donation of medical-grade respiratory masks will be given to health officials in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, and Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province.
