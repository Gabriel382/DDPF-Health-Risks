UPDATE 1-Morocco's RAM airline suspends flights to China amid coronavirus -state news agency 
 (Adds dates and background) 
RABAT, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Moroccan airline Royal Air Maroc (RAM) will suspend direct flights to China on Friday until Feb. 29 amid the coronavirus outbreak, state news agency MAP reported. 
The decision was made because of “a very low demand” on Casablanca-Beijing flights, the agency said. 
RAM began a direct air route on Jan. 16 with three flights weekly to Beijing from Casablanca. 
No case of coronavirus has been registered so far in Morocco. Three days ago the government said it would repatriate 100 Moroccan nationals, mostly students, from the Wuhan area, which has been locked down by Chinese authorities to deal with the virus.
