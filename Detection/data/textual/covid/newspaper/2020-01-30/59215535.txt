Two Australians contract deadly coronavirus in China 
 Health Minister Greg Hunt has confirmed two Australians in China have been infected with coronavirus â€“ but have since been released. "My advice before coming to this event from the national incident centre in our morning briefing is that two Australians did contract the virus in Guangdong province," Mr Hunt said. "They have been treated and the advice that I have, and I would want to be cautious on this, is that they have been released and are not seeking consular assistance at this stage."
