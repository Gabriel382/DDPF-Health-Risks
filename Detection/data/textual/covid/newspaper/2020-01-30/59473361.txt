Coronavirus - Fake news about killer bug rampant as Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter scramble to contain spread 
 FAKE news about coronavirus seems to be spreading faster than the actual virus, as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter struggle to contain misinformation.

Some spurious stories state that the virus originated in a seafood and meat market in Wuhan and that parents are abandoning their children in an airport.

Twitter officials say they have begun to steer users to official information when they search for terms related to the coronavirus.

In a blog post on Wednesday Twitter said: “We’ve launched a new dedicated search prompt to ensure that when you come to the service for information about the #coronavirus, you’re met with credible, authoritative information first."

Facebook says it’s placing warning labels on fake news and sending notifications to users who have shared debunked content.

Google says it's promoting authoritative sources such as health experts, public health institutions or media outlets at the top of search results and in "watch next" panels on YouTube.

YouTube has invested heavily in prioritising videos from legitimate sources to reduce the spread of misinformation, Google said.

While BuzzFeed is keeping a running list of debunked coronavirus claims on social media from its origin to treatments to fabricated government communications.

Axios reported that nearly 13,000 posts across Twitter, public Facebook pages, and Reddit between January 24 and January 27 had spread conspiracy theories.
