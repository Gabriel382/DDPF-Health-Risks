 Hedge funds started to disclose their holdings at the end of 2019 in new 13F filings. They have 45 days from the end of each quarter to disclose their positions in publicly traded US stocks, options, and convertible debt. Insider Monkey tracks more than 750 hedge funds and usually more than half of these hedge funds will wait until the last day to file their 13Fs with the SEC. Fortunately, our experience shows that aggregate hedge fund sentiment towards most stocks don't change much. In this article we are going to take a look at how hedge funds have been feeling about a stock like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and compare its performance against other similarly valued stocks like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).

Why do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that historically hedge funds' stock picks outperformed the market by a large margin. That's why hedge fund industry became a $3 trillion industry. However,Â  you can't outperform the market by replicating the entire portfolio of an average hedge fund anymore. Luckily Insider Monkey came up with proprietary algorithms to identify the best stock picks of the best hedge fund managers. We have been sharing a portfolio of around 15 hand picked stocks in our monthly newsletter since March 2017 and generated a cumulative return of 87% vs. 47.7% S&P 500 ETFs during the same period (see the details here).

We leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. This December, we recommended Adams Energy as a one-way bet based on an under-the-radar fund manager's investor letter and the stock is still extremely cheap trading at an enterprise value/operating profit ratio of 1 (this isn't a typo). In January, we recommended a position in a dividend stock with a PE ratio of less than 7 that is growing its earnings and yields 11%.
