Chilean Peso 
 The Chilean peso dropped to a near two-month low of 800.29 per USD on Thursday, amid rising worries regarding the economic impact of China’s coronavirus outbreak on the country’s main export copper, as the death toll continues to increase. On Wednesday, the central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged, following months of unrest which initially erupted over a hike in metro fares and sent the currency to a record low in November.

Historically, the Chilean Peso reached an all time high of 838.18 in November of 2019.

The Chilean Peso is expected to trade at 764.27 by the end of this quarter, according to Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations. Looking forward, we estimate it to trade at 786.00 in 12 months time.
