Australians in lockdown on cruise ship over coronavirus scare 
 More than 20 Australians wereÂ  among thousands locked on a cruise ship in the Italian city of Civitavecchia during a coronavirus scare.

The Costa Smeralda ship - carrying 7,000 people - were kept on the ship since Thursday morning after a 54-year-old Chinese woman from Macau came down with flu-like symptoms the previous night.

The woman, who boarded the ship on January 25 in the port of Savona, was placed in an isolation unit on the ship with her partner.

The Costa Smeralda had visited Marseilles in France and the Spanish ports of Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca this week before docking on Thursday at Civitavecchia.

A spokesman confirmed there were 27 Australians on board at the time.

However, Italy's health ministry has now confirmed that two Chinese cruise ship passengers tested negative for the virus that has killed 170 people so far in the city of Wuhan.

Costa Cruises was offering to pay for food and hotels for some 1,140 people who had been due to disembark at the Civitavecchia port near Rome early Thursday, and the Costa Smeralda was to set sail again Friday, Italian media said.
