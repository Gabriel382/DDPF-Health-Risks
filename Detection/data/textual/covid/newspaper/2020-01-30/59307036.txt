Vietnam says three new cases of coronavirus detected - state media 
 HANOI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Three new cases of coronavirus have emerged in Vietnam, the official health ministry newspaper said on Thursday, bringing the number of active cases in the Southeast Asian country to four.

Two people are being treated for the virus in the capital Hanoi, the Suc Khoe & Doi Song newspaper said. Another is receiving treatment in the northern province of Thanh Hoa, 160 km (100 miles) from Hanoi, the report said.

All three recently returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the new virus was first identified, it added.

Last week, the health ministry said two Chinese citizens in Vietnam had tested positive for coronavirus. One has since recovered. (Reporting by Phuong Nguyen and Khanh Vu Writing by James Pearson; editing by John Stonestreet)
