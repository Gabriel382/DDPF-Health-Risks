First Case Of Coronavirus In India, Kerala Student Being Monitored: Government 
 India's first case of Coronavirus has been reported in Kerala, the government said today amid global fear about the viral outbreak that has caused 170 deaths in China. "One positive case of Novel Coronavirus patient, of a student studying in Wuhan University, has been reported in Kerala," the Health Ministry said in a media statement.

The patient is in isolation in the hospital, said the statement, adding that the "patient is stable and is being closely monitored".

Over 400 people are under surveillance at their homes in Kerala for possible exposure to the virus. Authorities have screened nearly 30,000 passengers at various airports across the country so far.

Possible cases are also being monitored in isolation wards of hospitals in various cities including Delhi and Mumbai.

The health ministry had asked people who have a travel history to China since January 1 to report at the nearest health facility if they experienced any symptoms such as fever, cough or breathing trouble.

The Centre has decided to take steps for possible evacuation of over 250 to 300 Indians who are reportedly stuck in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

The virus has caused alarm because it is still too early to know how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. Also because it is new, humans have not been able to build immunity to it. Scientists hope to be testing the first possible vaccines in three months' time. China is testing the HIV drug Aluvia as a treatment.

The new virus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS, which killed nearly 800 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03.
