Russia closes China border as coronavirus spreads 
 MOSCOW: Russia said on Thursday it was closing the border with China to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus and would stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin told a government meeting that the order had been signed “to take measures to close the border (with China) in the Far East”. “We have to do everything to protect our people,” he said. According to the government order, cross-border travel would be suspended from Friday. A number of checkpoints will be affected, including between Blagoveshchensk and Heihe, Khabarovsk and Fuyuan, it said. The Russian foreign ministry said that as of Thursday it would stop issuing electronic visas, which can be used to cross into parts of the Far East and western Russia, to Chinese citizens. The foreign ministry also advised Russians to refrain from travelling to China and for those already there to get in touch with the Russian embassy. Russia does not have any confirmed cases of the new virus but Moscow has set up a task force to prevent its possible spread. In the corporate world, Alphabet Inc's Google and Sweden's IKEA were the latest big names to close China operations. South Korea's Samsung Electronics extended holiday closure for some Chinese production facilities. China virus toll hits 170 China reported its biggest singleday jump in novel coronavirus deaths on Thursday, as global fears deepened with more infections confirmed overseas. The World Health Organization, which initially downplayed a disease that has now killed 170 in China, was readying to meet Thursday to decide whether to declare it a global emergency. Many countries have urged their citizens not to visit China, while some have banned entry for travellers from Wuhan.
