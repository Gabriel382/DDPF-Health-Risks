China's richest man donates £11,000,000 to help tackle coronavirus 
 Chinese tycoons have put their hands in their pockets to help scientists develop a vaccine for coronavirus.

The latest is China’s richest man Jack Ma who has donated 100 million yuan (£11 million) through his foundation.

Some of the money – £4.4 million – will go to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering.

The rest will go to scientists across the world who are working towards finding a vaccine.

Mr Ma, who is worth £32.9 billion, is the founder of e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba, which has already offered £110 million to buy medical supplies at hospitals treating coronavirus patients.

His foundation said on Weibo: ‘The Jack Ma Foundation will exhaust our abilities to provide more help to the development and growth of medical science.’

A total of £500 million has been raised by companies and individuals, according to Chinese Entrepreneurs magazine.

The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China has risen to 170, with 7,711 cases reported within the country, authorities in Beijing say.

The new figures come as the World Health Organisation (WH0) emergency committee is expected to meet on Thursday to decide whether to declare an international public health emergency.

Meanwhile, a planned flight to bring British nationals back to the UK from coronavirus-hit Wuhan on Thursday has been put on hold.

The British Government had anticipated flying around 200 UK citizens out of the country but it is understood Chinese officials have not yet granted permission for the chartered flight to depart.
