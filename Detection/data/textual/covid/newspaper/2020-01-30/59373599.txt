Coronavirus: India confirms first case, with 800 others under observation 
 India has become the 20th country to confirm a case of coronavirus which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has so far claimed 170 lives.

The case could be the tip of the iceberg with a further 800 Indians are currently under observation after displaying symptoms of the disease.

The confirmed patient is a female student from the state of Kerala who had contracted the disease while studying at Wuhan University before returning home for a holiday.

The Indian Government has said the student is in a stable condition and is being treated in isolation in a hospital in Thrissur district.

“We had sent blood samples of 20 people from Kerala, of which 10 returned as negative. Out of six that were pending, the sample of a female student from Wuhan has come back as positive,” said Kerala’s health minister K.K. Shylaja Teacher.

India is the world’s second most heavily populated country after China and public health experts have expressed fears over the highly-contagious virus spreading in its densely populated cities.
