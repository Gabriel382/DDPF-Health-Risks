Masks Sell Out Across Hong Kong as Coronavirus Spreads 
 People waited in line in Hong Kong on January 29 for protective face masks amid a coronavirus outbreak that has left 170 dead in China. Thousands of people queued at Abouthais to get their hands on protective masks, according to local reports. Abouthai posted to Facebook an apology for running out of masks, promising new batches would give priority to front line service workers. “The masks in all stores have been sold out. As citizens who want to buy masks exceed expectations, they fail to meet the expectations of the general public. I am deeply sorry. In the next few days, Abouthai Department Store temporarily will not have masks on sale in stores, please don’t wait in line." On January 30 Watsons sold out a limited stock of face masks after some people queued around the block. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said there were 6065 global cases of coronavirus, with almost 6,000 of them in China and 8 cases in Hong Kong. At least 170 people have died in China from the virus, according to reports. The rise in the number of cases prompted the head of the WHO to reconvene an emergency committee on the virus to hear whether the organisation should announce an international public health emergency.
