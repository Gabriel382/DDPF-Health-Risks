Man Utd 'turn attention to Salomon Rondon' in Solskjaer's striker search 
 SALOMON RONDON has emerged as a target to fill Manchester United's desperate need for a new striker.

Reports suggest the Dalian Yifang forward could be available for a loan deal amid China's ongoing coronavirus crisis.

The Chinese Super League has delayed the new season as the World Health Organisation considers declaring an international public health emergency.

United are desperate for a new striker with Marcus Rashford injured for a number of weeks and the team struggling for goals regardless.

And target man Rondon would add an extra element having scored 12 goals and set up a further seven for Newcastle last season.

That earned him the big money move to Dalian, following ex-Magpies boss Rafa Benitez in the process.

A large array of strikers have been linked with Old Trafford this month.

Carlos Tevez and Odion Ighalo count as some of the more far fetched rumours with Islam Slimani, Edinson Cavani and Krysztof Piatek also named.





Hertha Berlin were prepped to snap up the AC Milan ace on Wednesday in a £23million deal after United attempted to pull off an 18-month loan swoop.

Norwegian teenager Erling Haaland appeared to be Solskjaer's priority heading into the month, before he signed for Borussia Dortmund.

In just two games for the German giants, he has bagged five goals to let United know what they are missing.

But Solskjaer has welcomed Bruno Fernandes to the club to fill his gaping hole in midfield, signing the Sporting CP man for £68m pending official confirmation.
