HANGZHOU, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 30th Jan, 2020 ) :It will take at least three months to prove a vaccine for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is effective, renowned Chinese epidemiologist Li Lanjuan said Thursday in an exclusive interview with Xinhua. 
"As of Wednesday, we have isolated five strains of the virus, two of which are very suitable for vaccine development," Li said. 
Chinese health authorities announced Thursday that 7,711 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps by the end of Wednesday.
 A total of 170 people have died of the disease.
