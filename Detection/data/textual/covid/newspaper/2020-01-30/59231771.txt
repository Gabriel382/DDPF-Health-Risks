Gov't to Shoulder All Costs for Coronavirus Treatment 
 The central and local governments will shoulder all costs for coronavirus treatment, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said Wednesday.

So far 187 people, including four who tested positive for the new mystery virus, have been quarantined.

The National Health Insurance Service will pay all the medical costs of those with confirmed and suspected cases of the disease from when they are quarantined until they are released.

Meanwhile, the Environment Ministry and the Korea Customs Service have temporarily banned imports of Chinese wild animals that might transmit coronavirus.

Banned animals include bats and snakes, which are suspected of being intermediate hosts of coronavirus, as well as badgers, raccoons and civet cats, which were believed to be intermediate hosts of SARS.
