'Contagion' Streams Have Skyrocketed Due To People Buggin' Out About Coronavirus 
 Contagion. Remember Contagion? I’d understand if you didn’t — from what I remember it was quite dull and the general audience seems to agree, as the movie’s 63% user score is far lower than its 84% critics score.

Directed by the guy who made the Ocean’s Eleven trilogy and Magic Mike, Contagion is a 2011 film that “follows the rapid progress of a lethal airborne virus that originates in Hong Kong and kills within days” and stars an absolutely stacked ensemble cast that includes Marion Cotillard, Bryan Cranston, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kate Winslet.

Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? Well, that’s because we’re currently living it (albeit on a much smaller and less terrifying scale) right now as the public tries to wrap their heads around what’s happening with the coronavirus in China.

And due to that current mini-panic, people have begun revisiting the 2011 film, as reports indicate that Contagion has cracked Top 10 on the iTunes movie rental chart this week.

Now, watching a movie about a deadly virus outbreak while the origins of a deadly virus seem to be unfolding in real life isn’t the route your boy is taking, different stroke for different folks, ya know? Especially if that ole doomsday click is ticking a little quicker than usual.
