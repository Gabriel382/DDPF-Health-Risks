UK Stocks-Factors to watch on Jan. 30 
 Jan 30 - Britain's FTSE 100 index is seen opening down 41 points on Thursday, according to
financial bookmakers
    * ROYAL DUTCH SHELL: Royal Dutch Shell said on Wednesday director Euleen Goh would take
over as its deputy chair from May 20.
    * FERROVIAL: Spanish engineering and construction firm Ferrovial, owner of London's
Heathrow Airport, plans to sell mature assets and buy into water infrastructures and Latin America's
electricity grids, company executives said on Wednesday.
    * WOODFORD: Investors in the collapsed equity income formerly run by British money manager Neil
Woodford will get 75% of the value of the fund in their first pay-out, its administrator said on
Wednesday.
    * OIL: Oil prices fell as the death toll from the new virus in China climbed to 170 and more
airlines cancelled flights to the country's major cities, while rising U.S. crude inventories added to
the negative tone.
    * GOLD: Gold prices edged higher on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair's remarks that the
new coronavirus outbreak could impact China's economy in the short term boosted the safe-haven metal's
appeal.
    * The UK blue-chip index closed up 0.5% on Wednesday after a steep sell-off earlier this
week on rising fears over the impact from the coronavirus, though the bounce lost some punch as oil
majors dipped alongside crude prices on U.S. stockpile data.
