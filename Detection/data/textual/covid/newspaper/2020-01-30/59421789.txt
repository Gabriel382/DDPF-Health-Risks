Global smartphone shipments dropped 1.1% in Q4, says IDC 
 Market researchers at IDC said that global smartphone shipments fell by 1.1% in the fourth quarter, driven in part by weakness in China, where consumers seem to be waiting for less expensive 5G devices to come to market and for network coverage to improve. "Huawei's performance continued to be strong in China, but while it has been diligently building up a presence as a top tier smartphone player in Western Europe, that's where shipments saw the biggest hit," IDC Associate Research Director Melissa Chau said in a release. "Things will continue to look challenging for Huawei given that the trade war is still not yet resolved while new uncertainty raised around the Wuhan coronavirus could potentially have adverse effects on not just Huawei, but all players reliant on the China smartphone supply chain." Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.81% took the top spot in terms of shipment market share during the quarter, IDC said, followed by Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, -3.21% and Huawei. But Samsung and Huawei beat out Apple for full-year 2019 market share, the analysts said.
