Kiwi woman quarantined at her flat in China describes the 'eerie' daily struggle 
 Georgia Ryan, 21, is largely confined to her flat in China due to the coronavirus outbreak but can still reach out to friends and family over the web.

A Kiwi woman quarantined in her flat in Sichuan China because of the coronavirus said it's awful knowing there is no escape.

"It feels as though the walls are closing in."

Georgia Ryan, 21, of Mt. Maunganui, moved to China six weeks ago to get qualifications in teaching English as a foreign language.

Fortunately, it is an online course which she can continue in her flat. Otherwise life is bleak without social media, ability to go to the gym, or access to her teaching work experience.

She said her lifestyle has dramatically changed, explaining that even receiving food has become a struggle.

"I never thought I'd ever have to go through anything like this."

She orders food online, and the delivery person has to stay two metres from the food once it has been placed at the building entrance.

If she steps outside to fetch the food, she has to be disinfected immediately once she returns inside. Hands, arms and hair are all thoroughly sprayed down as caution to the virus.

Fresh vegies and meat are hard to find due to all markets being closed in Ryan's area, which she believed is impacting her energy levels. Food mainly consists of rice and dried noodles.

From her window she normally sees hundreds of people commuting to work, doing Tai Chi or just enjoying the city.

Now she is lucky to see two to three people.

"It's an eerie feeling," she said.
