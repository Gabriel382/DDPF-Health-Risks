Coronavirus in York? Paramedics whisk 'Chinese man' to hospital 
 Paramedics wearing hazmat suit in York have whisked a man to hospital amid fears he may have coronavirus.

The unidentified man, who is believed to be Chinese, had checked into the budget Staycity Hotel yesterday.

A guest in the room – who also hasn't been identified – is thought to have called a doctor after he became unwell.

Paramedics took him and two guests, who are all understood to be Chinese, from the hotel shortly at 8pm last night.

The Yorkshire Post reports that the man's room has now been cordoned off and the building will undergo a deep clean.

A spokeswoman for the hotel group said: 'We are in conversation with Public Health England.

'He was taken away by paramedics masked up and suited so obviously (coronavirus) is the concern.'

However, they added they have not had any confirmation of diagnosis or advice at the minute.

The woman said it was not known if the group had travelled from China or which hospital he had been taken to.

The Department of Health refuses to comment on individual cases. It will announce an update on confirmed infections at 2pm.
