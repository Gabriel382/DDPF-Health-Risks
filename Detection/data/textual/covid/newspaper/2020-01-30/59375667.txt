US economy grows at 2.3 percent in 2019, slowest year of Trump presidency 
 The U.S. economy grew at a 2.3 percent in 2019 according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the lowest rate of growth in Donald Trump's presidency.

It's a fall from 2.9 percent the previous year.



Trade was one factor in the slowing economy. A drop in U.S. exports held growth back, while imports increased, albeit at a slower rate. Increased government spending helped prevent a steeper fall.
