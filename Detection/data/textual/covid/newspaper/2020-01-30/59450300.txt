WHO declares public health emergency over coronavirus 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday declared a public health emergency of international concern over the outbreak of coronavirus.

"The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries," said Dr.Â Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO.

"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it," he added.

The cases have been centered in China, and the WHO said it has confidence in China's response to the virus.

The first person-to-person transmission in the United States was reported Thursday as well, but officials said the risk to the general American public remains low.
