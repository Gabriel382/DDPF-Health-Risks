Apple rumored to release a stack of new gadgets in 2020. Here's what we know. 
 We know from multiple reports that Apple is planning to launch an affordable, 4.7-inch smartphone, likely dubbed the iPhone SE 2, this March.

But what about all the other gadgets the company is working on for the near future? Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has a list (via MacRumors), and it's an interesting one.

Apple reportedly plans to launch new iPads with a triple rear camera and 3D sensing support, paving the way for better augmented reality (AR) applications. The iPads should arrive as early as March.   The company will also launch new MacBooks, although it's unclear whether there will be a new MacBook Pro or a new MacBook Air. A new 13-inch MacBook Pro with a scissor-switch keyboard mechanism (like the one seen in Apple's recently released, 16-inch MacBook Pro) appears more likely, but we may also see both.

While new iPads and MacBooks are business as usual for Apple, the rest of Kuo's list is more interesting as it includes some entirely new devices — and perhaps even a resurrection of the company's cancelled AirPower charging mat.

Starting with that one, Kuo claims Apple is working on a "small wireless charging mat." Details are absent, so it's hard to speculate on just how close to AirPower this thing will be. All we can say is that there are numerous third-party products which perform a similar function to the AirPower, so perhaps Apple will do something similar to one of those.  Another interesting gadget on the list are "high-end headphones." Details are, again, absent, besides Bluetooth support. We've heard about Apple working on Apple-branded headphones from Bloomberg early last year, though it's hard to say whether this is the same product. Headphones are an incredibly crowded market, but Apple has shown it can lead the way with AirPods, and the "high-end" bit indicates these could be very interesting. Finally, Apple is apparently working on Ultra Wideband tags, possibly called AirTags. These would be tiny gadgets that you could attach to any item and then track its location, similar to the ones produced by Tile.

Kuo also mentioned the possibility of the coronavirus outbreak postponing some of these products — something we've reported on recently — or even cause them to have different (weaker) specs.
