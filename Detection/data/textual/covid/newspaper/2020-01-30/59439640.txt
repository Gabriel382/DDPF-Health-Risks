The bureau said there were 595 Chapter 12 family farm bankruptcies last year.

In addition to retaliatory tariffs from Beijing that hurt soybean exports, U.S. farms were also impacted by Trump's trade negotiations with Mexico and China.

"The trade wars were salt in an existing wound," said Kara O'Connor, government relations director at the Wisconsin Farmers Union, calling the spike in bankruptcies "completely predictable."

Trump's new phase-one agreement with Beijing states that China will agree to buy $32 billion more than it did since the trade war began.

The Trump administration has acknowledged that phase one leaves more to address with trade between China, the administration says phase two will maintain billions of dollars in tariffs in Chinese goods to ensure Beijing keeps negotiating.

On Wednesday, Trump signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Republicans estimate will add .03 to .04 percent to gross domestic product growth and create 176,000 new jobs.
