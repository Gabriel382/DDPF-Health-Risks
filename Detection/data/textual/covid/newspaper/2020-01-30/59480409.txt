Late Wall St rally set to boost local market 
 Commodity prices remain pressured by ongoing uncertainty as to what impact the coronavirus outbreak will have on global demand.
On Thursday, Brent crude futures slumped as much as 3.5 per cent to $US57.71 per barrel, leaving the global benchmark down 19.6 per cent from the highs seen in early January. They currently trade at $US59.15 per barrel, benefitting from the late rebound on Wall Street.
Iron ore futures in Singapore continued to slide, closing at $US81.65 per tonne in overnight trade, the lowest level since mid-November. Spot prices, according to data from Fastmarkets MB, also fell on Thursday.
Base metals were also hit hard, copper included.
“There appears no end in sight for the selling in the base metals sector,” ANZ senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes said. “Copper recorded its twelfth straight day of falls, the metal’s longest losing streak in more than three decades. This highlights how crucial copper is in the manufacturing industry in China.”
