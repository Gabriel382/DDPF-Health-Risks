Previous WHO health emergencies 
 The World Health Organisation can declare a "public health emergency of international concern" if a disease outbreak threatens several countries and if coordinated global action is needed.
Between introducing this alert system in 2005 and the coronavirus outbreak this year, the UN health agency has sounded its top-level alarm five times.
* EBOLA, 2019: The deadly fever has gripped a border region of Congo for more than the past year. Efforts to stop the virus have been hampered by unrest and violence in the area. More than 2200 people have died so far.
* ZIKA, 2016: The mosquito-borne virus spread across Latin America and beyond. More than 1 million people were infected in Brazil, the centre of the outbreak. The virus has been linked to head deformations in newborns.
* EBOLA, 2014: The worst known Ebola outbreak in history killed more than 11,000 in West Africa. More than 28,000 people fell ill. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were hit the hardest.
* POLIO, 2014: The WHO raised the alarm following cross-border infections in central Asia, the Middle East and Central Africa. While the other emergencies on this list have been declared over, the WHO has upheld the top alert for polio. However, infections have only occurred in Afghanistan and Pakistan in the past two years.
* SWINE FLU, 2009: An H1N1 influenza virus outbreak in Mexico turned into a pandemic. At least 152,000 people around the world are estimated to have died in 2009. Since then, this flu has occurred seasonally, but vaccines against it have been developed.
