Man Utd 'pondering transfer deadline day swoop' for Salomon Rondon 
 Salomon Rondon could be a shock target for Manchester United as they look to acquire a striker before the transfer window closes on Friday night.

United announced their first signing of the window on Thursday evening as midfielder Bruno Fernandes joined from Sporting Lisbon, putting pen to paper on a five-and-a-half year deal.

But the team are still desperately short up-front following the long-term injury to Marcus Rashford, and they have been linked with a whole host of potential signings, including Edinson Cavani, Christian Benteke and Islam Slimani.

And according to The Times Rondon is the latest surprising name to be linked with a move, with the 30-year-old potentially available on a loan deal until the end of the season.

Rondon, once of West Brom and Newcastle, now plies his trade in China for Rafael Benitez's Dalian Yifang, and he could be free to move due to the fact that the Chinese Super League have postponed their start to the season due to the ongoing coronavirus epidemic.

As a player with plenty of Premier League experience Rondon could be a tempting option for United, who are unlikely to splash out huge amounts of money after they spent Â£47m plus add-ons for Fernandes.

He found the back of the net 28 times in 119 appearances for West Brom, while his season-long loan spell at Newcastle saw a return of 12 goals in 13 games.

Another of United's targets, Krysztof Piatek, joined Hertha Berlin on Thursday afternoon, meaning their options for reinforcements up front are running out.

It remains to be seen whether they have a new striker lining up for them before their Premier League game against Wolves on Saturday, with United desperate for victory to put the pressure back on fourth-placed Chelsea after losing their last two matches in the division
