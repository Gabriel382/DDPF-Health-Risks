U.S. securities regulator to monitor companies' coronavirus impact... 
 WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The chair of the U.S. securities regulator on Thursday said he had directed staff to start monitoring companies' disclosures related to the "current and potential effects" of the coronavirus on their businesses.

"This is an uncertain issue where actual effects will depend on many factors beyond the control and knowledge of issuers," chair Jay Clayton said in a statement.

"However, how issuers plan for that uncertainty and how they choose to respond to events as they unfold can nevertheless be material to an investment decision." (Reporting by Michelle Price Editing by Chris Reese)
