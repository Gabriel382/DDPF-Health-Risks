Tiger Air passengers exposed to coronavirus 
 Passengers on a Tiger Air flight have been urged to contact health authorities after a man diagnosed with coronavirus travelled with the airline earlier this week.
Queensland Health today confirmed a 44-year-old man infected with the virus had travelled with Tiger Airways on January 27 on flight TT566 from Melbourne to the Gold Coast.
Any person on the flight is being urged to contact health authorities on 13HEALTH for advice.
The man is being quarantined at the Gold Coast University Hospital.
“The man, who is from the city of Wuhan (Hubei Province), is stable,” Queensland’s chief health officer Jeannette Young said in a statement.
All travellers who have been in contact with coronavirus must self-isolate for 14 days.
“This is a precautionary measure following new advice around the time frame that people may be contagious before showing symptoms,” Dr Young said.
The news comes after Health Minister Greg Hunt confirmed two Australians in China had been infected with the virus.
Mr Hunt said they are being treated and are not seeking consular assistance at this stage.
They were in Guangdong province, not Hubei province where the majority of cases have been located.
There are now seven confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia with four in NSW, two in Victoria and one in Queensland.
On Wednesday, the number of coronavirus cases in China jumped to 5,974, surpassing the 5,327 people diagnosed with SARS.
The death toll, which stood at 132 Wednesday, is lower than the 348 people who died in China from SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.
