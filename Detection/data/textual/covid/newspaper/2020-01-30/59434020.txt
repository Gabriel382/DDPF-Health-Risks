Coronavirus influencers are a thing now. You knew it would happen. 
 Some influencers are now sharing photos donning surgical masks and #coronavirus. You knew it was coming.

On Tuesday, Instagrammer Jada Hai Phong Nguyen shared a photo pairing her black mask with a checkered black and white pants and crop top. It has since gained over 1000 likes.

She advised her followers to avoid the virus by wearing a mask (she uses the Cambridge Mask N99 Pro, apparently) and to wash their hands. She also wants her followers to avoid contact with sick people and to cover their mouths when coughing and sneezing.

In an interview, the Vietnam-based Instagram model said that she decided to share the photo because so many people, even her family, are still uninformed about the seriousness of the outbreak.

"Now they know," she wrote. "I'm happy."

Pairing her mask with a plaid skirt, Instagram-user Jeii_pong appeared to be standing in Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Tuesday. She's gotten more than 32,000 likes.

Adena Wilson, adenawilson.ph on Instagram, told her fans that "PREVENTION is better than cure."

More than 7,900 people have been infected with the disease that has already claimed 170 lives.

Cases have spread to every province and region in China, with the total in mainland China overtaking the number of people infected during the 2003 SARS outbreak there.

While sales of facemasks have spiked in China and around the world, wearing one is not as effective as hand-washing and avoiding contact with people who may be infected.

Insider has reached out to the influencers for comment.
