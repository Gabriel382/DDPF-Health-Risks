American Airlines pilots sue to halt US-China flights amid coronavirus epidemic 
 The Allied Pilots Association, a union representing 15,000 American Airlines pilots, has sued the company to halt the carrier's U.S.-China service, citing "serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus."

The union asked the court for a temporary and immediate restraining order halting the flights as the virus spreads.

"The safety and well-being of our crews and passengers must always be our highest priority â€” first, last, and always," said APA President Capt. Eric Ferguson. "Numerous other major carriers that serve China, including British Airways, Air Canada, and Lufthansa, have chosen to suspend service to that country out of an abundance of caution."
