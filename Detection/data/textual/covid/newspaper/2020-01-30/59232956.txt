Jetstar Japan asked Chinese tour group not to board flight over virus concerns 
 NARITA, Chiba -- Jetstar Japan Co. requested a group of 23 Chinese tourists who had traveled in Japan with a person infected with the new coronavirus not to board a Jan. 28 flight from Narita International Airport, east of Tokyo, to Kansai International Airport, near Osaka.

According to the Narita-based low-cost carrier, it confirmed that the group had traveled for a time with a Chinese person who was diagnosed with the coronavirus while in Japan and admitted to hospital. Furthermore, another member of the group had developed a fever, but had not yet been diagnosed by a doctor. To prevent the spread of infection, on the night of Jan. 27 the airline contacted the tour group via the travel agency that had reserved their seats to Kansai Airport and asked them not to board their flight the next day.

"We can't exclude the possibility that the infection would spread. It was necessary to prevent secondary transmission to other passengers," Jetstar explained.

The company's conditions of carriage state, "If carrying you or your Baggage may put the safety of the aircraft or the safety or health of any person in the aircraft in danger or at risk," "we may refuse to carry you."

According to a Japanese government source, the group has returned China.
