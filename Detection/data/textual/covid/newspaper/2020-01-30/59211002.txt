Cases of New Coronavirus Registered in All Chinese Regions - Authorities 
 The total number of confirmed new coronavirus cases in China has reached 7,711, and the death toll from the new virus strain has gone up to 170, China's National Health Commission said on Thursday.

A day earlier, the health authorities said that there were 5,974 confirmed coronavirus cases, and 132 patients have died.

According to the authorities, 37 deaths and 1,032 new coronavirus cases have been recorded in Hubei alone within the past 24 hours. Ten more people have been released from hospitals.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is set to convene an Emergency Committee meeting on Thursday to discuss the rapid spread of the virus. WHO’s director-general traveled to China and praised the country’s response to the outbreak during a meeting with President Xi Jinping on Tuesday.

The novel coronavirus is believed to have originated from a market in Wuhan that sells live animals such as birds and mammals for people to eat.

Across the world, countries and transportation entities are taking steps to limit travel to China, as the threat from novel coronavirus intensifies.

In January almost a dozen international air carriers grounded or limited their flights to mainland China ina a bid to preven the spread of the virus. Among those companies are Air Canada, British Airways, Lufthansa, American Airlines and United.
