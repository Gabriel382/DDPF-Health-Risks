 Coronavirus case: Health Ministry sends results to South Africa, death toll hits 170 








 The Ministry of Health has sent results on the suspected Coronavirus case to South Africa for further validation.
The outcome of the results will then determine the next cause of action to be taken.
This is the first suspected case of coronavirus in the country that emanated from a Kenyan who flew in from China on Tuesday.
According to the Ministry, the passenger arrived at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) from Guangzhou, China, and after the screening, was found to have a fever.
He is said to have left China's Wuhan City - the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic that has so far killed more than 100 people, on January 20.
The patient was then put under isolation at JKIA before being moved to KNH's Infectious Disease Unit.
