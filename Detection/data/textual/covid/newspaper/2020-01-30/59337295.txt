After a brief pause, oil prices have declined yet again on the back of the fear of the potential economic impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

The rise in the number of coronavirus cases has led to an increasing number of people restricting their travel to China. Many countries have also issued advisories asking their citizens to refrain from travel to the country. As a result, fuel prices are expected to drop further in the coming days.
