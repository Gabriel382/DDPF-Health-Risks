Three Japanese nationals who returned from Wuhan on the government-chartered flight have pneumonia caused by infection of the new coronavirus, the health ministry confirmed on Jan. 30.

One of the three, a man in his 50s, has a fever of 38.7 degrees and complained about a runny nose and sore throat after arriving in Japan on Jan. 29.

The other two, a man in his 40s and a woman in her 50s, have not displayed symptoms, the ministry said. They are the first people in Japan without showing symptoms to be diagnosed as being infected with the new coronavirus.

The first chartered plane brought back 206 Japanese nationals from the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, the center of the outbreak of the deadly disease, on Jan. 29.

Irrespective of the presence or absence of symptoms, 204 people underwent virus inspections. Two passengers who did not show symptoms refused to be tested.

Twelve people complained of feeling sick and were admitted to hospitals in Tokyo.
