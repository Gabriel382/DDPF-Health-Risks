Empty jars to plastic sheets, people are using weird things as protection against coronavirus 
 As the coronavirus spreads rapidly in China and across the world (with the first case confirmed in India on Thursday), photos are emerging on social media of people taking unusual measures to protect themselves. Photos of people at different locations using everyday items like empty water jars and plastic sheets to cover themselves are doing the rounds of social media. Photos were posted of a group of passengers at an airport with plastic sheets over their heads. There is one photo of a woman covered in a plastic sheet at a departmental store, with a protective layer of plastic over the goods as well. One man on a flight from Shanghai to Perth was photographed wearing a helmet as protection. Multiple airlines have reduced or suspended flights to China, including British Airways and United Airlines. Here are some of the tweets going viral online: Some smart tricks to defy the menacing virus going around in China. Photos circulated from a friend in Guangzhou. pic.twitter.com/Cnky8097jm — Wu Gang (@WuGang_CX) January 29, 2020 Today in Chinese hazmat suits… #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/OwZPuXAKke — C 0 N T Λ G I 0 N W Λ V Ξ (@inteldotwav) January 30, 2020 What about this ? #coronoavirus #humainstupidity pic.twitter.com/WlzCgl8rRq — MoiMême (@RasgoCom) January 30, 2020 #coronavirus #Wuhan What kind of protection is this?? 🙄 pic.twitter.com/GHawe4JF2b — Potemkin Hırsızı (@Ptmknhrsz) January 29, 2020 pic.twitter.com/lCednoM7Y7 — Infant turd powder (@zhanginu) January 29, 2020 上有天堂， 下有宇航❓ This father and little girl in #杭州 #Hangzhou found an astronautical way to recycle water jugs in order to help combat the Earth's #coronavirus I wonder whose idea it was; daddy's or daughter's?

However, the new strain of coronavirus is “more severe” than the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1), he said. The virus has killed 170 people in China and infected more than 7,800 globally, but most of them are presently in China. The virus has caused alarm because it is still too early to know how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads among people. Chinese officials say it is infectious during its incubation period, which could range from one to 14 days. (with inputs from Reuters)
