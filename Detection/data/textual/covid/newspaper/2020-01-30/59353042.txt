'Heartbreaking' choice for Australians trapped in Wuhan 
 Darwin Bureau chief Matt Cunningham says “the government has probably taken the best option it has when it comes to Christmas Island," over Australia's coronavirus evacuation plans. Criticism has surfaced surrounding the coalition’s plan to use facilities on Christmas Island as a quarantine centre for Australian evacuees from Wuhan but Mr Cunningham told Sky News host Peter Gleeson “you do worry that things are starting to get away from authorities even here in Australia”. News.com.au Finance Editor Alexis Carey said the coronavirus has “dominated the front page around the country”. Ms Carey said the current situation faced by Australians in Wuhan "is absolutely heartbreaking". Despite the $1000 evacuation fee facing Australians trapped in Wuhan, Ms Carey said, “at the end of the day if that was you, you would want to pay anything you could to just get out and be safe”.
