Wuhan virus: US sees first case of human-to-human infection 
 WASHINGTON (AFP) - US health officials said on Thursday (Jan 30) they had identified the first case of a person who had caught the 2019 Novel Coronavirus from another person on American soil, a man who contracted the illness from his wife.

"The second person in Illinois testing positive for the Novel Coronavirus is a Chicago resident and is the spouse of the first confirmed travel associated case in Illinois," said Robert Redfield, director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

The first confirmed case concerned a woman in her sixties who had recently travelled to Wuhan.

Her husband did not travel to China.
