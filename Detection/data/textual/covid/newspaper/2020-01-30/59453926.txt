Wuhan evacuee tries to leave California air base 
 A passenger on the US evacuation flight from the coronavirus outbreak epicenter in Wuhan has reportedly tried to leave a California military base less than halfway through a mandatory 72-hour observation period.

Riverside County Health officials issued a quarantine order requiring the passenger to remain at March Air Reserve Base on Thursday.

The subject of the order, who was not identified, was one of 195 passengers who landed at the base in Riverside on Wednesday morning on a flight chartered by the State Department to remove US diplomats and private citizens from the virus-stricken Chinese city of Wuhan.

All of the passengers are being monitored for coronavirus symptoms on the base for 72 hours to ensure they do not pose a risk to the public.

'Riverside County Public Health Officer Dr Cameron Kaiser issued the order requiring the person to stay for the entire incubation period or until otherwise cleared,' a news release from the county stated.

'This action was taken as a result of the unknown risk to the public should someone leave MARB early without undergoing a full health evaluation.'

All 195 passengers underwent at least four health screenings prior to their arrival at MARB - including two before departing from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport and two more during a refueling stop in Anchorage, Alaska.

Though none of the passengers have showed signs of illness, they agreed to stay at the base voluntarily as a precaution, according to Dr Chris Braden of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

As of Thursday afternoon more than 8,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide and 170 people have died, all of them in China.

Six cases have been confirmed in the US and 168 possible cases are under investigation.
