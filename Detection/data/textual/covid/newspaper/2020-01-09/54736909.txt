China's pneumonia outbreak caused by mystery new respiratory virus, authorities confirm 
 A mystery new virus has been identified as the cause of a cluster of nearly 60 pneumonia cases in China which have put health authorities around the world on high alert.

The infections, caused by a novel coronavirus, are reminiscent of the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that spread from China in 2002, killing almost 800 people.

But the Chinese authorities said yesterday that, although the virus was new, it did not appear to be spreading from human to human as SARS did.

Xu Jianguo, the scientist who led the team that analysed the samples, said preliminary results showed that the newly detected virus - in the same family as both SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) - was different from other known human coronavirus species.

Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said that new viruses always posed a risk.
