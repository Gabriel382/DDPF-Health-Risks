 This guidance outlines infection control for healthcare providers assessing possible cases of WN-CoV. It should be used in conjunction with local policies.


In the absence of effective drugs or a vaccine, control of this virus relies on the prompt identification, appropriate risk assessment, management and isolation of possible and confirmed cases, and the investigation and follow up of close contacts to minimise potential onward transmission.
