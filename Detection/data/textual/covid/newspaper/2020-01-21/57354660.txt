Australian shares to rise despite China virus outbreak 
 Australian shares are expected to open higher, despite fears of a deadly virus outbreak spreading beyond China causing global markets to fall.

By 7:10am (AEDT), ASX futures were up 12 points, or 0.2 per cent, which suggests the local market could recover some of yesterday's losses.

The Australian dollar fell moderately to 68.4 US cents.

It was a stark contrast to last week's optimism, when Wall Street jumped to record highs after the US and China signed a "phase one" trade deal and there was an upbeat start to earnings season.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices lost 0.2 per cent by 3:20pm (local time).

But the Dow Jones index was hardest hit, down 135 points (or 0.5 per cent) to 29,213.

Some of the hardest-hit US stocks overnight were the ones which rely on foreign tourism like Tripadvisor (-1.5pc), casino giant Wynn Resorts (-6.3pc) and United Airlines (-4.4pc).

Worries about the coronavirus were intensified because it comes just days ahead of the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people are expected to catch flights.

The outbreak, which began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, also worried financial markets as investors recalled China's severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002-2003, which killed nearly 800 people.

"The fear is that it could be a SARS-type event, which was an economic issue," said Ellis Phifer, market strategist at US financial services firm, Raymond James.

Spot gold slipped to $US1,557 an ounce, while Brent crude oil fell sharply to $US64.52 per barrel.

More to come.
