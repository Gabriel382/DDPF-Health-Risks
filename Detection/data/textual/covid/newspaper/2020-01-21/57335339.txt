First case of deadly China virus identified in U.S. 
 The CDC today will announce that a case of a new Chinese virus has been detected in the United States, two individuals familiar with the announcement told POLITICO.

The agency has scheduled a 2 p.m. briefing with reporters, where scientists are expected to announce that the deadly coronavirus is spreading through human-to-human contact, the individuals said.

The mystery virus, which was first reported in the city of Wuhan in late December, has sickened more than 200 people, claimed at least four lives and spread to at least four other nations. The virus causing the disease is the same general type that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003, as well as some forms of the common cold.
