Stocks retreat from record highs at open as investors return from holidays 
 U.S. stocks opened modestly lower on Tuesday as the stock-market took a breather from its record-breaking climb, amid some worries around muted global growth and a respiratory virus spreading in China. Investors were returning from the holidays on Monday, in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. day. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.33% was down 0.3% to around 3,321. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.16% shed 51 points, or 0.2%, to 29,297. The Nasdaq Composite DJIA, -0.16% fell 0.3% to 9,364. Concerns around sluggish global growth resurfaced after the International Monetary fund trimmed its gross domestic product forecast for the world. The outbreak of the coronavirus in China has helped to dampen the mood of investors in Asia, producing sharp declines overnight in Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets. In company news, shares of Halliburton Co. HAL, +0.10% traded higher after the oil services company reported a less severe drop in fourth-quarter revenue than expectations.
