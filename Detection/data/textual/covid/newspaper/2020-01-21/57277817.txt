The virus, called 2019-nCoV, was first detected in Wuhan, in central China, at the end of 2018. As it is a new strain of coronavirus — one that infects the nose, throat, or sinuses — scientists are scrambling to understand and treat it.Authorities on Monday said the virus could spread from one human to another, having previously said they believed it could spread only from animals to humans.Fears that the virus could spread further are heightened as hundreds of millions of Chinese people prepare to travel to mark the weeks-long Lunar New Year celebration — traveling around the country and the world, often in crowded trains and planes.The World Health Organization said it would hold a meeting Wednesday to decide whether to declare "a public health emergency of international concern" and what recommendations to make. It previously declared such emergencies for swine flu and Ebola.
