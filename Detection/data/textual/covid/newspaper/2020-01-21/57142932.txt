Aus to screen overseas passengers for new coronavirus 
 Border Force officials will monitor flights between Australia and China as health authorities respond to the outbreak of coronavirus. The virus, which causes pneumonia, began in the city of Wuhan but cases have since been detected across China and in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Australia's Chief Medical Officer said there was no cause for alarm but officials would keep an eye on passengers - including those on direct flights from Wuhan to Sydney. Image: AP
