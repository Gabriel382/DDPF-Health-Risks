ASX snaps record streak as China virus spooks Asian markets 
 Loading
"We are concerned about a potential market impact from the coronavirus outbreak in China’s Wuhan," wrote currency exchange analysts from investment bank Nomura in a note explaining why they were moving to lower-risk positions.
"Our experience with the SARS virus outbreak suggests the market will be watching the mortality rate very closely. The mortality rate for SARS was around 10 per cent, and the Wuhan coronavirus has a mortality rate of around 2 per cent thus far. Also, markets sold off early during the  SARS epidemic, while Asia rates curves generally flattened, and markets recovered once the new SARS infection rate stabilised (around two months after February)."
The consumer staples sector outperformed the rest of the ASX, with a gain of 1 per cent thanks to a 2 per cent rise in Woolworths to a record high closing price of $40.01. Coles Group gained 1.3 per cent to $16.13. The worst performing sector was information technology, down 1.3 per cent, but the most points were taken away by small declines in the financial and industrial sectors.
Shares in online electronics retailer Kogan dropped another 7.3 per cent to close at $5.73 after tumbling more than 22 per cent yesterday after it missed analyst expectations for first half performance. It's the first time the stock has been below $6 since October, and the lowest price since late August.
