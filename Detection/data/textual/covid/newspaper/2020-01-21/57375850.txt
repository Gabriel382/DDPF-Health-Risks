Airports have been checking passengers from China for signs of the so-called coronavirus. About 300 people who had been in China have been infected; six have died.

One man in Seattle has been confirmed to have the virus. Washington state officials say the man is not considered a threat to the public.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is aware of the virus.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. The origin of this virus seems to be linked to Hua Nan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, a large seafood and animal market in the city.
