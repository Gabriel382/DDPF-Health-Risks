Fears of Coronavirus Spreading Over Lunar New Year 
 A traveler from China has been diagnosed here with a new type of coronavirus that is spreading rapidly in the world's most populous country.

Chinese health authorities warned earlier this week that the virus can be transmitted from human to human, raising fears that it could spread quickly. It has killed three people there so far with the number of cases probably exceeding over 200 already.

Health officials here are bracing to stem the spread ahead the Lunar New Year holiday, when the Chinese travel abroad en masse.
