        * Rebar down 1.2%, hot-rolled coil retreats from record high

MANILA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Steel futures in China slipped on Tuesday after four straight sessions of gains on concerns over slowing housing demand and the potential economic fallout from an outbreak of a new flu-like coronavirus in the country.

Benchmark Dalian iron ore prices were little changed, however, after BHP Group   maintained its 2020 iron ore output forecast, providing some relief amid concerns over supply of the steelmaking raw material.

The Shanghai Futures Exchange's most-traded construction steel rebar contract SRBcv1 dropped as much as 1.2% to 3,558 yuan ($516.24) a tonne.

Hot-rolled steel coil SHHCcv1 further retreated after touching a record high on Monday, ending the morning trade down 1.2% at 3,597 yuan a tonne.

"Data showing steel production in China rose 10.7% year-on-year in December buoyed markets late last week. However, the spectre of slowing demand from the housing sector has checked that exuberance," said Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at ANZ Research.

Chinese homebuilders should continue to face difficult conditions in 2020, with flat sales volume growth and modest price gains, Fitch Ratings said in a statement last month. prices in China, the world's top steel producer and consumer, grew 0.4% in December from the prior month, after slowing down for six straight months.

Mounting worries about the spread of a pneumonia-like virus in China, which sparked sell-offs in stocks and metals, also spilled into the steel futures market. market participants are trying to sell everything ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday," a Shanghai-based steel and iron ore trader said.
