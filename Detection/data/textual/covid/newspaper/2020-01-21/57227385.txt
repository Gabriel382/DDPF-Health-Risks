The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday (20 January) said global growth, estimated at 2.9% in 2019, is projected to increase to 3.3% in 2020 and inch up further to 3.4% in 2021. Compared to the October World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast, the estimate for 2019 and the projection for 2020 represent 0.1% reductions for each year while that for 2021 is 0.2% lower. A more subdued growth forecast for India accounts for the lion's share of the downward revisions.

India's growth is estimated at 4.8% in 2019, projected to improve to 5.8% in 2020 and 6.5% in 2021 (1.2 and 0.9 percentage point lower than in the October WEO), supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as subdued oil prices. India's domestic demand has slowed more sharply than expected amid stress in the non bank financial sector and a decline in credit growth, IMF said.
