The 19-year-old, who was not identified in the AsiaWire report, was allegedly fed Chinese leek in hopes that the battery would pass through her stool, but when that did not happen she was taken to the hospital.

      Doctors removed the leaking battery from the woman's stomach 14 days after she swallowed it.

“The patient swallowed the battery a long while ago,” Dr. Yu Changbo, of Changchun Tumor Hospital, said, according to AsiaWire. “It had already been 14 days. Fortunately, the battery did not make its way into her bowels and remained in her stomach.”

Changbo’s team performed a gastroscopy and found the large rechargeable radio battery in her stomach. They then attempted to remove it via her throat in a 60-minute procedure, he said. The woman is now recovering from slight chemical burns in her digestive tract.
