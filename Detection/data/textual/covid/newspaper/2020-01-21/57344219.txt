Coronavirus outbreak strikes US as Seattle, Washington hit with first case of deadly virus 
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed the first case of Coronavirus in the United States after a traveller from China was diagnosed in Seattle in the Washington state. China’s mystery virus has so far infected 291 people and killed six. The World Health Organisation is deciding whether the virus should be categorised as an international health emergency.

Most of the cases so far have been in China, but cases have now been reported in Thailand, South Korea and Japan.
The symptoms of coronavirus are fever, fatigue, sore throat and a cough.
Patients may also have difficulties in breathing.
When the virus was first contracted by humans from a seafood market in Wuhan, experts believed it could not be easily spread from human to human.
