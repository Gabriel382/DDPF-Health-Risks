CDC confirms first case of coronavirus in the United States 
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the United States. After returning to Seattle, Washington, from traveling in Wuhan, China, a man in his 30s began to experience pneumonia-like symptoms, the CDC announced Tuesday.

"Based on the patient's travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected this new coronavirus. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC overnight, where laboratory testing yesterday confirmed the diagnosis," the CDC said in a press release.

The man is being treated at a hospital in Everett, outside Seattle, and is in good condition, The Associated Press reported.

He returned from China on January 15. Two days later, the CDC and the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection implemented "enhanced health screenings" at the three U.S. airports that receive most of the travelers from Wuhan: San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX) airports. The CDC plans to add screenings at Atlanta (ATL) and Chicago (ORD) airports this week.

The screenings only affect travelers coming to the U.S. on direct or connecting flights from Wuhan, China.

The virus was originally thought to be spreading from animals to people, but CDC officials now say there is evidence that "limited person-to-person spread is happening."Â Six deaths from the virus have been confirmed so far.

Last month, patients experiencing fever, cough, and difficulty breathing began cropping up in Wuhan, in central China. More than 275 cases have now been confirmed in China, according to the World Health Organization.

"CDC is working closely with the state of Washington and local partners," according to the CDC press release. "A CDC team has been deployed to support the ongoing investigation in the state of Washington, including potentially tracing close contacts to determine if anyone else has become ill."
