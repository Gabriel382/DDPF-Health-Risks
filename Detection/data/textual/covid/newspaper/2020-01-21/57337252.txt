The First Case Of The Chinese Coronavirus Has Hit The US, CDC Reports 
 Federal health officials announced on Tuesday the first US case of the Chinese "coronavirus" outbreak that looks likely to spread worldwide.
"We have now confirmed the first case of novel coronavirus in the United States," said the CDC's Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
The patient, a man in his 30s from Snohomish County, Washington State, had his infection confirmed by a newly-developed CDC genetic test. He sought medical care on his own, and is in good condition at a medical center in Everett, Washington.

Messonier confirmed that the coronavirus, which apparently sprang from animal to human infections traced to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, does cause person to person infections.

Since late December, the virus has sickened more than 300 people in China and killed six. Cases have been reported in Japan, Thailand, and South Korea. The virus causes pneumonia like symptoms and appears most dangerous to the elderly or those with compromised immune systems.
The CDC announced on Friday that it would screen air travelers from Wuhan, China, the origin of the outbreak, at airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. China has since started similar screening, as have other countries in Southeast Asia. The outbreak seems to have started




      
        
        



  
  





"It doesn’t take much for a virus in general to go from being worrisome to being extremely worrisome because they tend to morph and mutate a lot," said Messonnier at a Friday update for reporters, where she had predicted a US case.
"We are especially worried and we’re taking a very cautious proactive approach."
