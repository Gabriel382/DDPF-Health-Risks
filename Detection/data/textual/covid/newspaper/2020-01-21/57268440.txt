 “Samples from the patient were first tested at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and yielded negative results for the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus or more often referred to as MERS-COV and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,” sabi ni Duque.

“However, the samples tested positive for non-specific pancorona virus assay, and the specimen has been sent to Australia to identify the specific coronavirus strain,” dagdag ni Duque.

“In severe cases, it could cause pneumonia, respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death,” ayon pa kay Duque.
