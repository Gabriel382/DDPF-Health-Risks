Macau stocks fall on virus worries 
 The World Health Organization is considering declaring an international public health emergency over the coronavirus in China. A total of 291 cases have now been reported in the nation, including incidents in Beijing and Shanghai.

While analysts have reported that Macau isn't seeing a drop in tourism yet due to the outbreak, casino stocks were hit hard in Hong Kong earlier today and are pointing lower in premarket U.S. trading.
