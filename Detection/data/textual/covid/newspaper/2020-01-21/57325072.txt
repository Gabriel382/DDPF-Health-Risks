New China virus: latest news on infection spreading in Asia 
 Scientists are increasingly concerned about a new virus that is spreading in Asia. The virus, which causes a respiratory illness, emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December and has infected some 300 people and killed at least 6. Thailand, Japan and South Korea are among the other nations that have also reported infections.

Researchers have identified the pathogen as a coronavirus, from the family that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed hundreds of people in 2002 and 2003. Chinese officials have also confirmed that the virus can spread from person to person.

21 January Infections have been confirmed in 15 health-care workers in Wuhan; scientists say this suggests that the virus is more adept at human-to-human transmission than was first thought. Previously, Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization had said that there had been some limited cases of human-to-human transmission between family members, but that animals seemed to be the most likely source of the virus.

In response to the worsening outbreak, the World Health Organization has called a meeting on 22 January to decide whether to declare a public-health emergency.
