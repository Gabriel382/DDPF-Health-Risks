Australia builds biosecurity barrier for China’s spreading coronavirus 
 Australia is establishing a biosecurity barrier to seal the spread of China’s coronavirus which has killed at least three people and infected more than 200 since the outbreak started in Wuhan, a major transport hub. Chinese authorities confirmed the virus was capable of spreading from person to person, with cases already surfacing across China, South Korea, Japan and Thailand. Millions of people are due to travel to China for the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins later this week. Image: Twitter / @RaynardToddnay1
