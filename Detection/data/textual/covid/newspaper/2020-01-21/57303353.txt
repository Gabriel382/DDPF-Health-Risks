India Issues Stringent Guidelines for Airlines from China, Hong Kong to Isolate Deadly Coronavirus 
 Stepping up its vigil to isolate the deadly coronavirus, the Indian Civil Aviation Ministry has called for the immediate implementation of the action plan that includes screening passengers arriving from China and Hong Kong at major airports across the country.

The government has organized all logistics support and made arrangements to screen passengers at cities like Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Cochin, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata airports.

All the passengers will also fill out self-reporting forms before disembarkation so that the filled blanks can be checked by health staff on arrival. The ministry also directed airline staff to bring passengers to the Health counters before allowing them to go through immigration checks.

The ministry has made it apparent that during screening if an ill passenger or crew member is confirmed as a probable case of Wuhan Coronavirus, “public health authorities should be notified about their contacts using the Passenger Locator Form”.
