Brisbane man being tested for coronavirus 
 A man is in isolation in his Brisbane home as Queensland Health authorities run tests on whether he is carrying a new strain for coronavirus.

The man was showing symptoms of the SARS-like illness.

Authorities say there is no cause for alarm.

It comes as Australia ramps up airport screening of passengers arriving from China.

The country's National Health Commission confirmed that the strain was passed from person to person and sparked fresh fears of a global epidemic.

More to come.
