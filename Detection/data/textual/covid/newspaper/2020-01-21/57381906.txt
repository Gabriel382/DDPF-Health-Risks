WHO: New Coronavirus Expected to Spread in China and Abroad 
 The World Health Organization says the new coronavirus is likely to spread in China and other countries and is urging governments to implement preventive infection control measures in health facilities. The WHO confirms 278 cases of the disease, including six deaths, two in China and the other four in Thailand, Japan and South Korea.

The WHO calls the coronavirus a fast-moving disease and says the number of cases and deaths is changing quickly. The agency is stepping up measures to get to the source of the infection as quickly as possible and to provide the public with information it needs to protect itself.

The WHO will be convening an emergency committee meeting Wednesday to see whether the virus constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. A team of experts is in the city of Wuhan, China where the outbreak occurred. The experts are working with local health officials to investigate the source of the disease.

WHO spokesman Tarek Jasarevic says not much is known about the new coronavirus. He says how the disease is transmitted, its severity, the extent to which it has spread or its source are unclear.

"Based on current information, an animal source seems the most likely primary source of this outbreak, with limited human to human transmission occurring between close contacts," he said. "Based on previous experience with respiratory illnesses, in particular with other coronavirus outbreaks and our analysis of data shared by China, human to human transmission is occurring."
