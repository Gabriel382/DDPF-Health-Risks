First U.S. Case Of Deadly Wuhan Coronavirus Found In Washington State 
 The first U.S. case of a new coronavirus strain that has killed at least six people in China has been reported in Washington state, according to multiple news accounts.


The deadly virus, which Chinese health officials have said can spread by human-to-human contact, has sickened hundreds of people, according to the mayor of China’s central city of Wuhan, where an outbreak is underway.


The male U.S. patient is a resident of Snohomish County, Washington, who was hospitalized last week with pneumonia after returning from a trip to Wuhan, The New York Times reported.


The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday said it has been actively screening incoming travelers from Wuhan City in Hubei Province. Exported cases have been confirmed in Thailand, Japan and the Republic of Korea.


The World Health Organization has said it will convene on Wednesday to determine whether the virus outbreak warrants being declared a global health crisis.
