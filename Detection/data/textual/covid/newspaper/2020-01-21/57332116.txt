 THE first case of mystery coronavirus in the US is set to be announced today, according to federal sources.

It's thought the person struck down by the virus is in Washington State.

The American patient was hospitalised for pneumonia last week and had recently travelled to  Wuhan, China where the respiratory disease was first spotted.

The patient tested positive for coronavirus over the weekend with officials stating the unidentified person is "quite ill".

The virus feared to be rapidly spreading across the globe.

It's estimated hundreds have been struck down by the virus, which is baffling docs, with six dead says CNN.

Chinese officials faced a race against time to contain the deadly new virus.
