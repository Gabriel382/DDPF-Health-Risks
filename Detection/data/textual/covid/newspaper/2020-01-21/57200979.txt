Coronavirus: what are the symptoms and could it be the next Sars? 
 It is the mystery new disease that has put authorities around the world on high alert. Already, four people have died and more than 200 others have been infected after contracting a never-before-seen pneumonia.

The disease, which emerged in China, has also crossed borders with cases in Japan, Thailand and now South Korea.

Tests have confirmed the presence of a novel coronavirus - one of a family of viruses which have proved particularly deadly over the last 20 years, infecting more than 10,000 people and killing around 1,600.

Experts are now asking if this new disease has similar epidemic potential.

But with so muchÂ still unknown, the authorities will have a battle on their hands to contain it.
