CDC confirms first case of Wuhan coronavirus in U.S. 
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Tuesday that a man has been diagnosed with the Wuhan coronavirus in the U.S.The mysterious virus, which has killed at least six people and sickened hundreds of others in China, was detected Monday in Washington state, officials said. No details about the person carrying the virus were immediately known, but the CDC said the patient had recently traveled to Wuhan, the Chinese city where the respiratory infection first emerged last month. The outbreak has reached at least three other Asian countries — Thailand, Japan and South Korea — and has led airports around the globe to screen travelers for the virus. New York’s JFK Airport, along with international airports in Los Angeles and San Francisco, began screening travelers last week. Authorities believe the outbreak may have originated from contact between humans and animals because the first cases are linked to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan. However, the Chinese government confirmed Monday that the new virus can spread from human to human, adding to growing fears of a massive outbreak and its potential impact on the economy.This is a developing story.
