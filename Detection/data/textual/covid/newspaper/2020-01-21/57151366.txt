 Man placed in quarantine in his home after fears he contracted coronavirus

A Brisbane man is believed to be the first in Australia to be tested for the deadly coronavirus that has already killed four people.

Queensland Health confirmed to Yahoo News Australia the man had suffered from symptoms similar to those people experience when they contract the virus after returning from a trip to China.

He has since been placed in isolation in his home.

This strain of the SARS-like virus has infected hundreds of people in Wuhan, China, since December.

More to come.
