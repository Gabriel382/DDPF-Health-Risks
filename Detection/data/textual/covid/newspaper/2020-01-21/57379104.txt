Australian shares set for steady session despite China virus outbreak 
 Australian shares are expected to open steady, despite fears of a deadly virus outbreak spreading beyond China causing global markets to fall.

By 8:50am (AEDT), ASX futures were down just 2 points, which suggests the local market is set for a steady start.

The Australian dollar fell moderately to 68.4 US cents.

On Wall Street, it was a stark contrast to last week's optimism, when the main share indices jumped to record highs after the US and China signed a "phase one" trade deal and there was an upbeat start to earnings season.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices lost 0.3 and 0.2 per cent by the close.

But the blue chip Dow Jones index was hardest hit, down 135 points (or 0.5 per cent) to 29,213.

Some of the worst affected US stocks overnight were ones that rely on foreign tourism, including Tripadvisor (-1.5pc), casino giant Wynn Resorts (-6.3pc) and United Airlines (-4.4pc).

Worries about the coronavirus intensified because it comes just days ahead of the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people are expected to travel around China and across the world.

The outbreak, which began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, also worried financial markets as investors recalled China's severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002-2003, which killed nearly 800 people.

"The fear is that it could be a SARS-type event, which was an economic issue," said Ellis Phifer, market strategist at US financial services firm, Raymond James.

Spot gold slipped to $US1,558 an ounce, while Brent crude oil fell to $US64.52 per barrel.
