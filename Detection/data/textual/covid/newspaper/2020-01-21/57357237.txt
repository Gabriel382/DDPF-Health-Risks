Australia 'vulnerable' to deadly Coronavirus virus 
 Health Minister Greg Hunt says Australia is "vulnerable" to the deadly Coronavirus virus because "we have a direct contact with China" but there are “no confirmed cases” in the country. A Brisbane man has been tested for the highly contagious virus, but “his symptoms have subsided and we are waiting for the pathology results,” Mr Hunt told Sky News. “We have declared this as a communicable disease with the potential to spread because there are risks, we should be absolutely clear about that. “The advice from health authorities and medical officers is for reassurance, we know that with any of these diseases there is never a good time for them. “We do have very well established protocols.” Image: News Corp Australia
