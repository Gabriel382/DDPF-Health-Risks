CDC to announce first case of Wuhan coronavirus in U.S.: reports 
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to announce Tuesday the first confirmed case of Wuhan coronavirus in the U.S., according to reports.The mysterious virus, which has killed at least six people and sickened hundreds of others in China, was detected this week in Washington state, according to the New York Times.No details about the person carrying the virus were immediately known, but federal officials reportedly believe the patient had recently traveled to Wuhan, the Chinese city where the respiratory infection first emerged last month. The outbreak has reached at least three other Asian countries — Thailand, Japan and South Korea — and has led airports around the globe to screen travelers for the virus. New York’s JFK Airport, along with international airports in Los Angeles and San Francisco, began screening travelers last week. Authorities believe the outbreak may have originated from contact between humans and animals because the first cases are linked to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan.CDC officials were expected to hold a news conference Tuesday afternoon.This is a developing story.
