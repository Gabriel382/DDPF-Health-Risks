Industrial metals decline as China virus scare hits sentiment 
 SINGAPORE, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Industrial metals fell on Tuesday, pulled lower as negative sentiment spilled over from the stock markets after person-to-person transmission of a new virus was confirmed in China, and following a rating downgrade for Hong Kong.

The coronavirus outbreak, believed to have originated in China's city of Wuhan has spread outside the country with cases reported in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Four people have died and more than 200 cases of the infection have been confirmed in China.

"Hong Kong ... was downgraded, plus the Wuhan virus. People are selling off risk assets," said a base metals trader, eyeing to market reactions at the time of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak.

The new virus causes a type of pneumonia and belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as SARS, which killed nearly 800 people globally over 2002-2003.

China is also gearing down for its week-long Lunar New Year holiday, starting on Jan. 24, with many traders closing their positions before taking time off.

Prices will be weak before the spring festival, as the holiday is also known, as demand usually decreases, said an analyst, who added that the sell-off was also related to concerns over the virus.
