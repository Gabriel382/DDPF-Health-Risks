U.S. stocks end lower following first reported U.S. case of coronavirus 
 U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday, falling short of last week's records, after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the first case of the coronavirus within the U.S., which sent jitters that originated in Asian equities rippling through Wall Street. The selloff in U.S. equities left the Dow Jones Industrial Average [S: DJIA] down 151.45 points, or 0.5%, at 29,196.6, breaking its five-day winning streak. The S&P 500 index [S: SPX] fell 8.77 points, or almost 0.3%, at 3,320.84 and the Nasdaq Composite Index [S:COMP] shed 18.14 points, or 0.2%, to settle at 9,370.81, after briefly turning positive mid-session to set a record intraday high of 9,397.58. Last week, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all posted their best weekly gains since Aug. 30, according to FactSet data. The virus's outbreak in China, which originated in the city of Wuhan, has sickened around 300 people, leaving six dead, according to Chinese state media and health officials.
