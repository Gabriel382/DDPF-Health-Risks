Event postponed in west Japan with Chinese sister city amid coronavirus outbreak 
 OITA -- A cultural exchange event between this city in western Japan and the Chinese city of Wuhan scheduled for February 2020 will be postponed following a deadly coronavirus outbreak, the Oita Municipal Government announced on Jan. 20.

The Oita government's Cultural and International Affairs Division said the event was planned to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the sister city partnership between Oita and Wuhan. The Japanese city was to invite five cooks from Wuhan and have a food event in front of JR Oita Station on Feb. 8.

According to the Oita city government, 198 people have been infected with the new coronavirus in Wuhan and three have died (according to the city of Wuhan, the death toll totaled four as of Jan. 21). The city of Oita proposed to Wuhan that the event should be postponed as it's unclear how far the virus could spread.

Meanwhile, the Japanese city said that a commemorative ceremony with the mayor of Wuhan will be carried out in Oita in March as planned, as well as that a plan for local junior high school students to visit the Chinese sister city remains unchanged.
