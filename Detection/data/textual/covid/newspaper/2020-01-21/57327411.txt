Coronavirus outbreak: How to prevent coronavirus 
 “Try to avoid crowded places. Make sure that you are considerate to others.
“If you have any symptoms, especially if you have got travel history to Wuhan, then please go and seek medical attention, and be honest and open with your doctors.
“Tell them of your travel history. Do not hide any history from your doctors because you fear ‘Oh, if I say this, I might be quarantined’.
“Please be honest to help yourself and to help others.
