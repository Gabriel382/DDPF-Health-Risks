Brisbane man being tested for coronavirus after trip to China 
 A SARS-like virus that has spread across China and reached three other Asian nations appears to have spread to Australia.

A Brisbane man is reportedly being tested for the deadly new strain of coronavirus after returning from a trip to China.

Queensland's chief health officer Jeanette Young told reporters the man had been isolated at his home.

The announcement came just hours after Australia's chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the risk posed to Australians by the new strain was low.

Wuhan, the sprawling capital of central China's Hubei province, is the epicentre of the coronavirus.

Biosecurity staff have been stationed at Sydney airport to meet the three direct flights a week from Wuhan to Sydney.

Queensland's Department of Health has been contacted for comment.

More to come.
