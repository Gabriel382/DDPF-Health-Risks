Sixth death reported in new coronavirus outbreak 
 Chinese officials said Tuesday that the death toll from an outbreak of a new form of coronavirus has climbed to six as authorities attempt to contain the disease's spread.

Reuters reported that the updated total comes as new cases were reported Monday in Guangdong province, Beijing, as well as in new areas of the country where it had not yet been reported including two in the northern city of Tianjin, nearly 12 hours away from the outbreak's first reported site.

The update comes as health officials said a day earlier that the virus has had its first confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, though health officials say such cases are still rare.

“The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan and other places must be taken seriously,” Chinese President Xi Jinping said Monday.  “Party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people’s lives and health first.”

Additional cases of the disease, thought to have originated in a seafood market now closed by officials in the city of Wuhan, have also been reported in Thailand and the Philippines as travel officials and health authorities in neighboring countries have scrambled to locate Chinese tourists possibly traveling with the disease's symptoms. The virus, a recently-unknown form of coronavirus, is thought to cause a deadly form of pneumonia.

China's health commission warned this week that the exact cause of the virus remains unknown, and encouraged local health officials to collaborate on containment efforts.

“However, the source of the new type of coronavirus has not been found, we do not fully understand how the virus is transmitted, and changes in the virus still need to be closely monitored," the commission said.
