Stocks are opening lower on Wall Street as concern about the impact of a Chinese disease outbreak grows. Other global markets also dropped, with Hong Kong and Shanghai falling sharply. Chinese authorities reported a coronavirus that has sickened more than 200 people can be transmitted from person to person. Investors bought U.S. bonds, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury lower. Airlines and other travel businesses are getting hit. Utilities and real estate are rising. The S&P 500 lost 9 points or 0.3% to 3,320.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

Stock and oil prices fell Tuesday as concern about the potential impact of a Chinese disease outbreak increased and a rating agency cut Hong Kong's credit rating for official borrowing due to political tension.

Indexes in London and Frankfurt declined and Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong closed sharply lower after China announced a fourth death from coronavirus. The outbreak, centered on the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has sickened more than 200 people.

Authorities said some infections were transmitted person-to-person, increasing the risk the disease might spread faster during the Lunar New Year holiday, the Chinese-speaking world's busiest travel season.

Other Asian governments stepped up screening of travelers from China, highlighting the potential impact on tourism. That prompted a selloff in of airlines, hotel operators and other travel businesses.

The outbreak “is developing into a major potential economic risk to the Asia-Pacific region,” said Rajiv Biswas of IHS Markit in a report.

Biswas pointed to the example of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, whose economic impact was felt as far away as Canada and Australia.

In Europe, London's FTSE 100 lost 0.8% to 7,588 and Frankfurt's DAX dipped 0.1% to 13,531. France's CAC 40 was 0.7% lower at 6,034.

On Wall Street, futures for the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average were off 0.3% and 0.2% as markets prepared to reopen after a three-day holiday weekend.

In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 1% to 3,063.56 and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 retreated 0.9% to 23,866.15.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 2.8% to 27,985.33 after Moody's Investors Service cut its government credit rating by one notch to Aa3 from Aa2.

Moody's cited the lack of “tangible plans” to respond to issues highlighted by six-month-old anti-government protests and said that may reflect “weaker inherent institutional capacity” than previously thought. The protests began in June over a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the Chinese territory.

Seoul's Kospi sank 1% to 2,2239.69 and Sydney's S&P ASX 200 lost 0.2% to 7,066.30. India's Sensex was 0.3% lower at 41,381.52. Southeast Asian markets also declined.

Air China Ltd. lost 3.2% and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways dropped 4.1%. Japan's ANA Holdings Inc. fell 2.2%.

Also Tuesday, the Bank of Japan left its policy rate at -0.1% and affirmed its commitment to increase holdings of government bonds. Board members raised their economic growth projection for the year that starts in April to 0.9% from 0.7%.

The European central bank also is due to make an interest rate decision this week. No change is expected though investors will pay attention to the bank's views on the economy.
