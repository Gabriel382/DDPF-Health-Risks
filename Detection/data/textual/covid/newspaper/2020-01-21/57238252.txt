The Deadly Coronavirus Might Have Reached Australia, As A Man Is Being Tested For The Bug 
 China has officially confirmed the outbreak of the new SARS-like virus which can be transmitted from human-to-human, and which has already claimed the life of four people, leaving at least 200 sick. Now, it seems that the virus has reached Australia. 
A man from Brisbane displayed symptoms of the fatal coronavirus after returning from a family holiday in China and has been placed in quarantine.

Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has announced a travel warning after the man was isolated when he returned from a family holiday, according to Daily Mail.
The man is yet to know if he has contracted the illness. 
The new strain of coronavirus which was traced by health officials to a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, was primarily passed from animals to humans.

The man was visiting his family in China's Wuhan province, which is known to be the epicentre of the terrifying outbreak.
The Prime Minister said that the government will be raising the level of travel advice for Wuhan City to level- 2 - that means, ‘travellers should exercise a high degree of caution’.

If the man has indeed contracted the Coronavirus, then it is a matter of global concern. The timing could not be worse as hundreds of millions are preparing to travel to China during the Lunar New Year period in China. So, there is a large possibility that it reaches other countries too. 
Meanwhile, India has also issued fresh instructions with regards to the outbreak and has sent guidelines to Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and other international airports. These guidelines are aimed to screen travellers for Coronavirus. All those who are travelling from China to India will be screened using thermal scanners, sources said. People should be conscious of traveling to China right now.
