First U.S. case of potentially deadly coronavirus confirmed in Washington state 
 A man in Washington state has been diagnosed with the mysterious virus, the first case reported in the United States since the pneumonia-like illness first appeared last month in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, people familiar with the investigation said.

The man, who is in stable condition, flew to the United States from China before federal health officials began screening travelers at three major U.S. airports.
This is a developing story. It will be updated.
