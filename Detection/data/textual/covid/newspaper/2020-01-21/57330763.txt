CDC Expected to Announce First U.S. Case of Wuhan Coronavirus 
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are expected to announce Tuesday afternoon that the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus has been reported in the United States. It is unclear whether the person recently traveled to China, how they became infected, or if it had been transmitted to anyone else in the country. The mysterious virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan last month, has reportedly infected more than 300 people and killed six. The outbreak has reportedly spread to five countries, including the United States. The head of a Chinese government team of experts said Monday that human-to-human transmission had been confirmed in the outbreak of the virus, which could cause it to spread more quickly and widely.
