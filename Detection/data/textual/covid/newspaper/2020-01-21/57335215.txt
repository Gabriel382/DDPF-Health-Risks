First case of deadly coronavirus detected in US 
 The first case of the deadly coronavirus sweeping Asia has been detected in the United States, according to a report.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to announce Tuesday that the flu-like virus has been reported in Washington state, CNN reported, citing a federal source outside the agency who it described as involved in the matter.

The mysterious illness — which can be transmitted between humans — is believed to have emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

The death toll from the virus rose to six Tuesday with the number of reported cases rising to more than 300.

Four cases were detected in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, leading to fears about its spread through international travel.

It’s unclear how the US patient became infected, whether they traveled to China or have transmitted the virus to anyone else, according to the report.

The CDC declined to comment Tuesday afternoon.
