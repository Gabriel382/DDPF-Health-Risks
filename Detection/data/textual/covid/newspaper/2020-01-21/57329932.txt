Russia Tightens Control Over Chinese Border on Coronavirus Fears 
 (Bloomberg) -- Russian authorities strengthened controls at border crossings with China to prevent a deadly strain of coronavirus from being brought into the country, the state-run RIA Novosti news service reported, citing acting Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova.

The mysterious virus has caused at least six deaths and infected a number of medical workers in China, a sign the illness can be passed from person to person. China raised the number of confirmed cases to 291 on Tuesday and its National Health Commission has warned there’s a risk of the virus spreading further.

Russia’s Federal Agency for Tourism warned travelers to avoid the Chinese city of Wuhan in relation to the outbreak until the situation stabilizes, RIA reported.

Russia shares its second-longest border with China, after the demarcation line with Kazakhstan, stretching for 4,209 kilometers (2,615 miles). Growing numbers of Chinese tourists and business people are visiting Russia as relations between the two countries have grown closer in recent years.
