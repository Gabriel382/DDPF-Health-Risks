Bernadas reminded that one’s health status would be one of the aggravating factors in cases of contracting a viral or any other disease.

“Atong paninguhaon nga magpabilin ta nga healthy. Complete rest, balanced diet ug exercise. Likayan pod nato nga ma-stress labi na akdtong mga naay diabetes, hypertension. Ang usa sa mga contributory factors or aggravating circumstances kung masakit ta mao man ang atong medical status,” Bernadas said in an interview following Duque’s statement.

Bernadas also advised the public to avoid getting into crowded places especially when they could see people who were having respiratory problems there, even the simple cough and colds.

“Kung ikaw mismo duna kay symptoms of respiratory infections, maglikay pod ka nga makatakod ka. Stay sa balay or wear protective masks,” Bernadas said.

Bernadas earlier assured that the DOH-7, the hospitals, local health units and the Bureau of Quarantine were on top of the situation and is following a protocol in facing the corona virus threat./dbs
