Chinaâ€™s Coronavirus Claims its Fourth Victim After Confirmed Cases Triple 
 A fourth person in China has been killed by a highly-contagious new virus which has spread rapidly across the country. The death of an 89-year-old man was announced by authorities on the same day when the number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus more than tripled to 218. The man lived in Wuhan, which is believed to be the city where the outbreak began. China's National Health Commission confirmed Monday that the infection can be transmitted from human-to-human. Some cases have been identified abroad including two in Thailand, one in Japan, one in Taiwan, and another in South Korea, according to BBC News. There are concerns that the spread of the virus could gather pace as millions of people across China prepare to travel home for the Chinese New Year holidays later this week.
