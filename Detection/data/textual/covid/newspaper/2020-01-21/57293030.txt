Asian equity markets were a sea of red as Wuhan’s coronavirus outbreak sparked profit taking in advance of Chinese New Year. Memories of and comparisons to the SARs outbreak back in late 2002 and early 2003 are fueling some media hype. The timing for the pneumonia outbreak is especially bad due to the mass migration that occurs around Chinese New Year and the weeklong holiday that begins this Friday. Historically we have seen profit taking prior to New Year’s as investors raise cash for spending. With the strong performance of markets over the last year, this profit taking has been more aggressive as evidenced by the fall in Hong Kong. Today was the last day for Southbound Connect trading before the holiday, which likely exacerbated the selling by Mainland investors in Hong Kong.
Stocks that have historically done well going into Chinese New Year (retail, travel, airlines, hotels, and Macau stocks) were all plastered. Healthcare stocks on the Mainland managed a gain as the only positive sector. Moody’s downgrade of Hong Kong government debt from Aa2 to Aa3 did not help Hong Kong stocks and reminds me of the saying “Always kick a person while they are down as you’ll never get a better chance.” Protests continue in Hong Kong though they have become more of a weekend phenomenon. Finding a positive catalyst to turn the situation around is difficult. 
Over the weekend the PBOC maintained the 1- and 5-year Loan Prime Rates at 4.15% and 4.8%, which the market largely anticipated though may have been hoping for another cut. There is some chatter that policy makers will take their feet off of the stimulus pedal post-Phase One. Personally, I am skeptical of this line of thinking as the global economy needs a sustained turnaround for this to occur. 
So, is it time to panic? No. The Chinese government has had a swift reaction to the pneumonia outbreak following the 774 global deaths attributed to SARS. I would suspect far more people died of the flu this past weekend in the US than in China due to the coronavirus. For what it’s worth, having just returned from China late last week I was worried in the last about the outbreak. The market has been primed for a correction and we are getting one. Many investors have been caught flatfooted by the strength of the Mainland market. I would suspect many investors will be putting money to work on weakness. Mainland markets close this Friday and will reopen on Friday January 31st while Hong Kong is closed next Monday and Tuesday.

The day’s “best performer” (tongue-in-cheek) was CSPC Pharma -0.94%/-2.52 index points while Geely Auto was the worst performer -5.26%/-12.2 index points. Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong were off -3.19% while Hong Kong-domiciled companies were off -2.59%, as tracked by the HS China Enterprise and HS HK 35 indices.

Southbound Connect flows were the heaviest in recent memory as Mainland investors were sellers of Hong Kong stocks for the first time in recent memory. One broker said it was the first time in 47 days, which feels about right. Southbound Connect accounted for nearly 9% of Hong Kong turnover while mainland investors sold $9mm of HK stocks.

TAL Education Group (TAL US) reported Q3 financials for the fiscal year 2020 before the US market open. While revenue, enrollment, and cash holdings were outstanding, the company’s costs increased substantially which led to lower income and EPS. With the stock up 78.9% over the last year as of last Friday, it is likely to see a meaningful drop today. Sell-side analysts haven’t had time to chime in though we are apt to see price targets cut. I’ll report back with more information tomorrow.

New Oriental Education (EDU US) reported Q2 fiscal quarter financials yesterday despite the US market being closed.
