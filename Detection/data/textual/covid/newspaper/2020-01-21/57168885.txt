points lower at 7,619 on Tuesday, according to financial bookmakers. 
    
    * BHP: BHP Group,, the world's biggest miner, maintained
its forecasts for full-year iron ore and thermal coal output, despite production
of the latter being hit by the Australian bushfires.
    * STAGECOACH: British transport company Stagecoach is taking the
government to court after it was excluded from bidding for rail contracts, in
the latest clash between a private company and the state in the troubled rail
franchising system.
    * SAVANNAH PETROLEUM: London-listed Savannah Petroleum told Reuters
on Monday it would consider oil and gas acquisitions in Nigeria

from an outbreak of a new flu-like coronavirus in the country.

bout of risk aversion and sell-off in Asian stocks.

cut interest rates hit London's FTSE 100 on Monday, while premium tonic water
maker Fevertree endured its worst day ever.
