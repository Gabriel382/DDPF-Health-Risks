(Update) Japan Confirms First Case of Wuhan-Linked Pneumonia - JIJI PRESS 
 Tokyo, Jan. 16 (Jiji Press)--The Japanese health ministry said Thursday it has confirmed the first case of infection in the country from a new type of coronavirus that led to an outbreak of viral pneumonia in the Chinese city of Wuhan. 

    A man in his 30s in Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo, has tested positive for the same coronavirus strain that sickened many people in Wuhan after returning from the city, the ministry said.

    The government is collecting information through a liaison office set up at the crisis management center of the prime minister's office.

    The man has had a fever since Jan. 3 while staying in Wuhan and had medical attention on Jan. 6 after returning to Japan, according to the ministry.

    After being hospitalized on Jan. 10, he left hospital on Wednesday as symptoms were relieved.
