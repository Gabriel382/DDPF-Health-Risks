Japan confirms first case of coronavirus that has infected dozens in China 
 Japan has confirmed its first case of a new coronavirus from China, the health ministry said Thursday.

A Chinese national who has traveled to Wuhan, eastern China, tested positive in Japan, the ministry said. The man in his 30s man lives in Kanagawa Prefecture. He returned from Wuhan on Jan. 6 and was hospitalized on Jan. 10. He has already recovered and was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday, the ministry said.

A ministry official said there are no other confirmed cases in Japan.

The pneumonia-like virus has infected dozens of people in Wuhan, with preliminary evidence suggesting the outbreak was associated with exposure at a seafood market.

The man treated in Japan has not been to the Wuhan seafood market, according to the health ministry. It is possible that he came in close contact with a person infected with the virus while in Wuhan, the ministry said.

Coronaviruses usually cause common-cold symptoms, infecting the nose, sinuses or upper throat, and are spread through sneezing, coughing or direct contact.

The health ministry issued a message to the Japanese public that it is important to wash hands and take other preventive measures similar to those taken against the common cold or influenza.

It also called on those who returned from Wuhan and have experienced fever and coughing to wear masks and visit medical institutions promptly. It advised them to report that they have been to Wuhan when seeing a doctor.
