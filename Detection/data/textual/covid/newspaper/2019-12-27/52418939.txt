Risk of Flu Increases on Days with High Levels of Fine Dust, Study Shows 
 People are more prone to contract the flu or catch a cold on days with high levels of fine dust pollution, a study suggests.

A research team led by Prof. Yang Yoon-joon at Inje University Ilsan Paik Hospital analyzed the relationship between patients with acute respiratory symptoms and their exposure to fine dust particulate, who visited some 192 hospitals across the country during the period from 2016 to 2017.

Their risk of respiratory infections such as adenovirus, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus increased by 1.3 percent to 10 percent, depending on the level of fine dust concentrations.

"It is believed higher levels of fine dust raise levels of oxidative stress, which causes infectious diseases, while weakening epithelial cells, which prevent entry of viruses," Yang said.

Yang advised people to take extra care by wearing masks during the winter when respiratory ailments are more common.
