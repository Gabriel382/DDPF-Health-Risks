'Start Here': Democratic senators running for president hit the campaign trail ahead of impeachment trial 
 It's Monday, Jan. 20, 2019. Let's start here.


1. Double duty


Just days before the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic senators who are running for president are squeezing in last-minute campaign stops before heading back to Washington, D.C., for the impeachment trial in the Senate this week.


On today's "Start Here," ABC News' Rachel Scott says some of the senators are planning to hit the trail when arguments aren't underway.


"The senators are trying to manage here, but it does give a big advantage to their rivals like former Vice President Joe Biden and [former South Bend, Indiana], Mayor Pete Buttigieg who will be able to spend nearly all of their time in these critical key early voting states and talk to voters," she says.


2. 'Leap of faith'


Prince Harry described the decision that he and his wife Meghan Markle made to renounce their titles as a "leap of faith" in his first public comments since Buckingham Palace announced the couple would no longer be working members of the royal family.

"What I want to make clear is we're not walking away, and we certainly aren't walking away from you," he said on Sunday.


As for what Harry and Meghan will do next, ABC News Foreign Correspondent James Longman in London tells the podcast, "The palace has made it quite clear, nothing has been agreed upon."

3. Huawei executive's hearing


The extradition hearing of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese tech firm Huawei, begins today in Vancouver, Canada, after her 2018 arrest at the request of the U.S. government.


The U.S. wants the Chinese executive extradited to face fraud charges for an alleged scheme to deceive global banks and the U.S. government to circumvent U.S. sanctions in doing business with Iran.


The case could take years to resolve and has put Canada in the crosshairs of the fight, according to ABC News' Aaron Katersky: "The Canadians have been seeking a better foothold with China, one of its larger largest trading partners, and so this case has really caused an international stir."


Meng is free on bail -- though she can't leave Vancouver -- and has denied any wrongdoing. Huawei has called her arrest an "unlawful abuse of process" and has claimed that the case against her is "political."

Even though the test went well, it's not clear when SpaceX will launch a manned mission to space. CEO Elon Musk has said in the past he hoped to do so in 2020.
