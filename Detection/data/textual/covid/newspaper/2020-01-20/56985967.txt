An outbreak of a new coronavirus in China is spreading to more cities.

Chinese health authorities on Monday (January 20) reported 139 new cases of pneumonia discovered over the weekend, including a third death. Experts say a new strain of coronavirus is to blame.



The outbreak has been linked to a seafood market in the city of Wuhan, where around 200 cases have been confirmed.



The virus belongs to the same family as SARS, and it can cause fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing. But there are still a lot of questions, like whether it's as deadly as SARS and just how easily it can be transmitted between humans.
