South Korea has confirmed the first local case of the mysterious coronavirus from China.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a 35-year-old Chinese woman who flew from Wuhan... had a fever, respiratory problems and other symptoms when she arrived at Incheon International Airport on Sunday.

She was quarantined and tested positive for the virus.

The KCDC has raised its infection alert level from "attention" to "caution."

China has reported more than two hundred cases of the virus since it first appeared in Wuhan in late December, and at least 3 people have died.

Experts say the virus belongs to the same family of coronavirus as SARS, but little is known about how easily it can be transmitted between humans.
