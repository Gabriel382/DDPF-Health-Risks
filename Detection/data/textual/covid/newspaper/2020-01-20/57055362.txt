CDC to start screening some travelers from China at three major U.S. airports for signs of Coronavirus 
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday it will start screening people traveling to the U.S. from Wuhan City in the Hubei Province of central China through three major airports for signs of a new virus that has sickened 40 people and killed two. The Coronavirus has been compared to pneumonia, as well as to SARS and MERS, two former respiratory illnesses that broke out in Asia. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. The initial screenings will take place at the airports that receive the most travelers from Wuhan, namely San Francisco International, New York's JFK and Los Angeles International. Cases of the illness have now been confirmed in Thailand and Japan, according to a CDC advisory from Thursday. Most of the patients in Wuhan had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread, although others had no exposure to animals, suggesting the disease can also be transmitted from person-to-person.
