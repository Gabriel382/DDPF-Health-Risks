Passengers arriving in Australia from China virus epicentre to be screened 
 The risk posed to Australians by a new strain of coronavirus infecting hundreds of people across the world is low, the nation's chief medical officer says.

The new strain of virus can be transmitted between humans, and the total number of cases in the world stands at 222.

"There is no need for alarm and the risk to the Australian public from this novel coronavirus remains relatively low," Brendan Murphy told reporters on Tuesday.

"Although, we do need to keep a precautionary and active surveillance of the situation."

Wuhan, the sprawling capital of central China's Hubei province, is the epicentre of the coronavirus.

There are three direct flights a week into from Wuhan into Sydney.

Each of these flights will now be met by biosecurity staff.

"No international travellers have yet been confirmed as having this coronavirus in Australia and we already have well-established existing biosecurity measures at the border," Professor Murphy said.

Information will be displayed across all other points of entry into Australia to warn people who develop symptoms to seek urgent medical attention.

Australian authorities will also work with the Chinese media to get the message across.
