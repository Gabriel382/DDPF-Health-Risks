WHO calls emergency meeting as mystery virus spreads 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) called for an emergency meeting on Monday as a mysterious virus spreads across China.

The meeting on Wednesday will assess whether the outbreak of the new coronavirus constitutes an international health emergency and what measures should be taken, Reuters reports.

The health organization said “an animal source” appeared to likely be the primary source of the outbreak, adding that some “limited human-to-human transmission” occurred between close contacts, according to Reuters.

WHO has not yet recommended trade or travel restrictions.

On Monday, Chinese officials also confirmed the first case of human-to-human transmission of the deadly virus.

The virus, which was first discovered in China’s Wuhan province, has spread to more Chinese cities including in Beijing and Shanghai, authorities reportedly said Monday.

South Korea confirmed its first case of the virus Monday, marking the fourth case reported outside of China's borders, according to Reuters.

The new cases bring the total known worldwide to 222, according to the newswire.
