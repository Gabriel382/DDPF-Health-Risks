Killer Coronavirus can spread between humans as new infections confirmed 
 China has confirmed a deadly strain of coronavirus can spread to humans, for the first time.

The deadly virus has now infected more than 160 people, with reports that this includes 14 health workers and 3 fatalities.

The commission confirmed the new virus, which is causing an outbreak of pneumonia in the country, has been passed from person-to-person and has infected some medical staff, China's official Xinhua news agency said.

Xinhua reported that Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the health commission team investigating the outbreak, confirmed two cases of infection in China's Guangdong Province were due to human-to-human transmission.

So far 217 people in China have been infected by the new viral pneumonia and there are also reports of a case in Thailand.

The Government has now vowed to step up monitoring during Chinese New Year to contain its spread.

The virus is a new strain of coronavirus, similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which originated in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide between 2002 and 2003.
