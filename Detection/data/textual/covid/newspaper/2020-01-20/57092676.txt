New cervical cancer test could save one in four and help wipe out disease 
 A NEW cervical cancer test could prevent one in four cases — and experts reckon the disease could be wiped out.

Scientists believe the new screening method, coupled with vaccines for children, could one day see the end of the killer in Britain.

The NHS has finished its roll-out of the test in which samples are checked for the human papillomavirus behind almost all cases.

Only those with the HPV are examined for abnormal cells.

Signs of infection can be spotted earlier before cancer develops.

Previously, only samples showing possible cell changes were tested.

Experts say the method could prevent 600 of the 2,500 new cervical cancer cases every year in England.

Alongside the screening, all 12 and 13-year-olds are offered a vaccine against HPV, which is spread through close skin-to-skin contact — usually sexual — and can cause other cancers in male and female genital areas.

Professor Peter Johnson, of the NHS, said cervical cancer could be “eliminated altogether” by the methods.

Last year, researchers said cervical cancer could be effectively eliminated in most countries around the world by the end of the 21st century thanks to the jab and improved screening.
