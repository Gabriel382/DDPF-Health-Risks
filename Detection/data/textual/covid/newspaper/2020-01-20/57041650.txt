South Korea confirms first case of new coronavirus: report 
 South Korea is reporting its first confirmed case of a new coronavirus that broke out in China and has infected more than 200 people there, according to Reuters.

South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reportedly said in a statement Monday that the patient, a 35-year-old Chinese woman, flew from Wuhan, China, to South Korea’s Incheon international airport and has been quarantined. The virus, a form of viral pneumonia, initially broke out in Wuhan and has killed three people.

“The confirmed patient was identified in the quarantine phase and there is no community exposure. Those that have come in contact, including passengers and aircraft crew, are currently being investigated,” the statement read, according to Reuters.

Chinese officials have said that 217 people have been infected by the virus in the country. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in remarks on Monday that it was important that the outbreak be taken seriously, according to The Associated Press, which cited CCTV.

“The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan and other places must be taken seriously,” Xi said. “Party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people’s lives and health first.”

There have also been reported cases of infections in Japan and Thailand.

The outbreak comes at a time of significant uptick in domestic travel in China for the Lunar New Year.
