Wuhan virus: MOH expands temperature screening; those with pneumonia and travel history to Wuhan to be quarantined 
 SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) is stepping up precautionary measures against the Wuhan coronavirus pneumonia in anticipation of more travellers in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holidays.

This includes expanding temperature screening for all travellers arriving from China at Changi Airport and issuing health advisory notices to them from Wednesday (Jan 22).

The MOH said in a statement on Monday that those found to have travelled to Wuhan within two weeks before the onset of pneumonia symptoms will be quarantined in hospital and investigated.

Together with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, the ministry has also developed a pamphlet about the disease and disseminated it to emergency department and infectious diseases physicians and public sector hospital laboratories.

There has been no confirmed case of the virus in Singapore so far.
