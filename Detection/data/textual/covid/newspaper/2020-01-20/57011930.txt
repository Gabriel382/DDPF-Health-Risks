China coronavirus outbreak: Why China virus threatens a repeat of 2002 SARS pandemic 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the China virus is a new strain that has not been previously identified.
The disease is most likely spreading through contact with infected animals, food and possibly through bodily fluids.
According to biologists Klaudia Zając and Adrian Zając of the Marie Curie-Skłodowska University in Lublin, Poland, another SARS-like epidemic has been on the table since 2002.
The researchers wrote in a joint-study: “Unfortunately, knowledge of these pathogens is still inadequate and the dangers carried by coronavirus infections are very real.
“These days people travel a lot, including very distant and exotic countries and so the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic, could turn out very dangerous since the virus could spread globally very quickly.
