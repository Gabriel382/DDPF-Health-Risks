Beijing insists it can control deadly virus 
 China insists a Sars-like virus outbreak that could spread across the country during Lunar New Year celebrations is "controllable" despite 17 new cases in the city of Wuhan. China's National Health Commission admits the disease's source was unknown, but vowed to "step up monitoring" of any mutations during the festival period. Millions of Chinese will be heading home to their families for the holiday, also called the Spring Festival, in the next few days. The disease, also known as the coronavirus, is connected to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 650 people in China and Hong Kong during 2002 and 2003. Of the 17 new cases in the central city of Wuhan, believed to be the epicentre of the outbreak and where 62 people are now affected, three were described as "severe". The disease has also spread overseas, with two cases in Thailand, and one in Japan. Two people have died so far, including a 69-year-old man in whom it caused pulmonary tuberculosis. Scientists from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London have warned that the number of cases in Wuhan is likely to be much higher than officially identified - closer to 1,700.
