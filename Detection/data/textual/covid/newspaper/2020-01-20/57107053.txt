ANC Brief: Still restive 
 Taal Volcano is still restive with the Batangas province still on edge. Here are the stories making the headlines on ANC today:

Into the danger zone

 The Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) warned there should be no commercial activity in Taal Volcano’s danger zone and nearby areas. Meanwhile, the volcano has not shown signs of quieting down. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said there are indications magma is still rising and that a big eruption is still possible.

Two-wheeled taxis

 Starting next Monday, all motorcycle taxis are considered illegal and will be impounded. That’s according to the Land Transportation and Franchising Board (LTFRB). Will this mean the death of motorcycle taxis in the metropolis? Senators Grace Poe and Bong Go said the pilot run of Angkas must continue. So, what happens to patrons of Angkas on Monday?

Bad deals

 Finance Sec. Carlos Dominguez said they are scrutinizing a prime land deal for allegedly being “onerous.” A party-list lawmaker Eric Yap wants a probe into the “lopsided” LRT-1 concession agreement. And the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said it wants to unlock the so-called “blue economy” by defining maritime territory.

Spreading

 There are reports three Chinese tourists in Boracay have been tested for the new strain of corona virus. The SARS-like virus is spreading in China with the celebrations of the new Lunar Year just around the corner.

Pet cause

 As relief operations continue in the aftermath of the Taal Volcano calamity, one group focuses their efforts on abandoned animals within the area. ANCX got to know the Guardians of the Fur, whose members share a love for man's best friend.
