Coronavirus emergency meeting called by WHO as fears of disease intensify 
 The World Health Organisation has announced an emergency meeting into whether a new Sars-like coronavirus constitutes international health emergency.

The meeting with be held in Geneva on Wednesday, WHO said.

It comes after the Chinese Government confirmed the virus is now spreading between humans.

The crisis meeting follows the virus spreading from Wuhan district, where it has infected nearly 200 people, to more Chinese cities, including the capital Beijing and Shanghai.

Medical workers are also reported to have been infected, bringing the total in China to 217.

A fourth case has also been reported beyond China's borders.

Cases have been reported in Thailand and Japan.

The virus is a new strain of coronavirus, similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which originated in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide between 2002 and 2003.

The development of the virus has sparked fears of a new global pandemic.

People at the epicentre on the outbreak in Wuhan are being urged to wear masks and to quickly seek medical help if they have a cough and fever.

But officials said the virus is not considered highly contagious and just passing by or talking to patients would not be a concern.

China has also sought to play down speculation that it could be a reappearance of the Sars epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved to cause more severe illnesses.

Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.v
