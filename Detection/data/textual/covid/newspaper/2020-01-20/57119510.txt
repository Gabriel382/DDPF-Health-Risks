                Chinese leader vows to combat rising viral outbreak

                
                
                
                    
                

            

        

    



                                    

                                
                                                
                        
            BEIJING — The head of a Chinese scientific team said Monday that human-to-human transmission has been confirmed in an outbreak of a new coronavirus, a development that raises the possibility it could spread more quickly and widely.


    
            Team leader Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China contracted the virus from family members, state media said. Some medical workers also have tested positive for the virus, the English-language China Daily newspaper said.


    
            The late-night announcement Monday capped a day in which authorities announced a sharp surge in the number of confirmed cases to more than 200, and China’s leader called on the government to take every possible step to combat the outbreak.


    
                                            
                    
            “The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan and other places must be taken seriously,” President Xi Jinping said in his first public statement on the crisis. “Party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people’s lives and health first.”


    
                                
            
                                

            
            The spread of the viral pneumonia comes as the country enters its busiest travel period, when millions board trains and planes for the Lunar New Year holidays. The outbreak is believed to have started last month at a food market in Wuhan in central China.


    
            Wuhan health authorities said Monday an additional 136 cases have been confirmed in the city, raising the total to 198. Three have died.


    
            Authorities also announced cases in other Chinese cities for the first time.


    
                                
            
            Five individuals in Beijing and 14 in Guangdong have been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, CCTV reported Monday. A total of seven suspected cases have been found in other parts of the country, including in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in the southwest and in Shanghai.


    
            Zhong said the two people in Guangdong had not been to Wuhan but fell ill after family members had returned from the city, the China Daily said.


    
            The outbreak has put other countries on alert as millions of Chinese travel for Lunar New Year. Authorities in Thailand and in Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China.


    
            South Korea reported its first case Monday, when a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the new coronavirus one day after arriving at Seoul’s Incheon airport. The woman has been isolated at a state-run hospital in Incheon city, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.


    
                                

            
            At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three U.S. airports — in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York — have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.


    
            Coronaviruses cause diseases ranging from the common cold to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS first infected people in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800.


    
            Xi ordered government departments to promptly release information on the virus and deepen international cooperation.
