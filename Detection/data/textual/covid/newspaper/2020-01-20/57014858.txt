Little is known about the Wuhan virus, apart from the fact that it has pneumonia-like symptoms — including fevers, coughs, and chest pains. It has been identified as as a strain of coronavirus — which is one that infects the nose, throat, or sinuses — and likened to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which infected large parts of Asia in 2003.At least three people in Wuhan have died from the illness as of Monday, local health authorities said.195 other people in the city have been infected, with 35 in "severe" condition and nine "critically ill," authorities said. The patients range from 25 to 89 years old, they said.Scientists at Imperial College London warned last week that the true number of infections could actually be over 1,700.

The outbreak has also spread to other Chinese cities including Beijing, Shenzhen, and possibly Shanghai, as well to Thailand, Japan, and South Korea.This outbreak could become even deadlier as millions of people in China prepare to travel back to their hometowns to celebrate Lunar New Year on Saturday.The US Centers for Disease Control in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York will also start screening passengers coming from China for signs of infection.
